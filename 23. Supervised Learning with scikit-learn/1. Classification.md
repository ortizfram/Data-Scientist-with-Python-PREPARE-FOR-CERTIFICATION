# Binary classification
**In the video, you saw that there are two types of supervised learning â€” classification and regression. Recall that binary classification is used to predict a target variable that has only two labels, typically represented numerically with a zero or a one.**

A dataset, churn_df, has been preloaded for you in the console.
- Your task is to examine the data and choose which column could be the target variable for binary classification.

      In [2]:
      churn_df.head()
- [x] "churn"
> churn has values of `0 or 1`, so it can be predicted using a `binary classification model.`
