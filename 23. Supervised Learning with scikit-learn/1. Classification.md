# Binary classification
**In the video, you saw that there are two types of supervised learning â€” classification and regression. Recall that binary classification is used to predict a target variable that has only two labels, typically represented numerically with a zero or a one.**

A dataset, churn_df, has been preloaded for you in the console.
- Your task is to examine the data and choose which column could be the target variable for binary classification.

      In [2]:
      churn_df.head()
- [x] "churn"
> churn has values of `0 or 1`, so it can be predicted using a `binary classification model.`
# The supervised learning workflow
      from sklearn.module import Model
      model = Model()
      model.fit(X, y)
      model.predict(X_new)
# k-Nearest Neighbors: Fit
```py
# Import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

# Create arrays for the features and the target variable
y = churn_df["churn"].values
X = churn_df[["customer_service_calls", "account_length"]].values

# Create a KNN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X, y)
```
# k-Nearest Neighbors: Predict
      X_new = np.array([[30.0, 17.5],
                  [107.0, 24.1],
                  [213.0, 10.9]])
```py
# Predict the labels for the X_new
y_pred = knn.predict(X_new) #nkk = model

# Print the predictions for X_new
print("Predictions: {}".format(y_pred)) 

# Predictions: [0 1 0]
```
> Great work! The model has predicted the first and third customers will not churn in the new array. But how do we know how accurate these predictions are?
