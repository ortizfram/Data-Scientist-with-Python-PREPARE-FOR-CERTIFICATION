- **tabular data** (most common way)

`dataFrames`
## 📚 quick explore to data
#### 🔽 .head()
❓ returns first five rows, and other if you specify

    dogs.head()
#### 🔽 .info()
❓ display column names and types. and whether if there's missing values

    dogs.info()
    print(homelessness.index)
#### 🔽 .shape
❓ tuple w/ number of (rows, columns) # attribute not a fuction

    dogs.shape
#### 🔽 .describe()
❓  calculates a few summary statistics for each column. (mean or median) # attribute not a fuction

    dogs.describe()
#### 🔽 .values()
❓ data values in a 2-dimentional Numpy array

    dogs.values()
    print(homelessness.values)
#### 🔽 .columns()
❓ labels of rows

    dogs.columns()
    print(homelessness.columns)

## 🦍 Inspecting a DataFrame

## 🦍 Parts of a DataFrame
```py
# Import pandas using the alias pd
import pandas as pd

# Print the values of homelessness

## 📚 Sorting and subsetting
#### 🔽 .sort_values('')
❓ pass column name to sort by insterest
    
    # in descending order
    dogs.sort_values('weight_kg', ascending=False)
    
    # sorting by multiple variables
    dogs.sort_values(['weight_kg', 'height_cm'], ascending=[True,False])
#### 🔽 subsetting columns
```py
    dogs['name']
    
    # subsetting mutiple columns
    dogs[['name','height_cm']]
    
    # subsetting multiple columns from var outside
    cols_to_subset = ['breed', 'name']
    dogs[cols_to_subset]
    
    # subsetting rows (BOOL)
    dogs['height_cm'] > 50
    
    # subsetting rows (VALUES)
    dogs[dogs['height_cm'] > 50]
    
    # subsetting rows (based on TEXT)
    dogs[dogs['breed'] == "Labrador"]
    
    # subsetting rows (based on DATES)
    dogs[dogs['date_of_birth'] < "2015-01-01"]
    
    # subsetting based on MULTIPLE CONDITIONS
    is_lab = dogs[dogs['breed'] == "Labrador"]
    is_brown = dogs[dogs['color'] == "Brown"]
    dogs[is_lab & is_brown]
    #--
    fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness['family_members']<1000) & (homelessness['region']=="Pacific")]
    
    # subsetting using .isin()
    is_black_or_brown = dogs["color"].isin(["Black", "Brown"])

```
## 🦍 Sorting rows
- [x] 1). Sort homelessness by the number of homeless individuals, from smallest to largest, and save this as homelessness_ind.
- [x] 1). Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.
- [x] 2). Sort homelessness by the number of homeless family_members in descending order, and save this as homelessness_fam.
- [x] 2). Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.
- [x] 3). Sort homelessness first by region (ascending), and then by number of family members (descending). Save this as homelessness_reg_fam.
- [x] 3). Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.
```py
# Sort homelessness by individuals
homelessness_ind = homelessness.sort_values('individuals')

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_ind.head())
```
```py
# Sort homelessness by descending family members
homelessness_fam = homelessness.sort_values("family_members", ascending=False)

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_fam.head())
```
```py
# Sort homelessness by region, then descending family members
homelessness_reg_fam = homelessness.sort_values(["region","family_members"], ascending=[True,False])

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_reg_fam.head())
```
## 🦍 subsetting columns
- [x] 1). Create a DataFrame called individuals that contains only the individuals column of homelessness.
- [x] 1). Print the head of the result.
- [x] 2). Create a DataFrame called state_fam that contains only the state and family_members columns of homelessness, in that order.
- [x] 2). Print the head of the result.
- [x] 3). Create a DataFrame called ind_state that contains the individuals and state columns of homelessness, in that order.
- [x] 3). Print the head of the result.
```py
# Select the individuals column
individuals = homelessness["individuals"]

# Print the head of the result
print(individuals.head())
```
```py
# Select the state and family_members columns
state_fam = homelessness[['state','family_members']]

# Print the head of the result
print(state_fam.head())
```
```py
# Select only the individuals and state columns, in that order
ind_state = homelessness[['individuals','state']]

# Print the head of the result
print(ind_state.head())
```
## 🦍 subsetting rows
- [x] 1). Filter homelessness for cases where the number of individuals is greater than ten thousand, assigning to ind_gt_10k. View the printed result.
- [x] 2). Filter homelessness for cases where the USA Census region is "Mountain", assigning to mountain_reg. View the printed result.
- [x] 3). Filter homelessness for cases where the number of family_members is less than one thousand and the region is "Pacific", assigning to fam_lt_1k_pac. View the printed result.
```py
# Filter for rows where individuals is greater than 10000
ind_gt_10k = homelessness[homelessness['individuals'] > 10000]

# See the result
print(ind_gt_10k)
```
```py
# Filter for rows where region is Mountain
mountain_reg = homelessness[homelessness["region"] == "Mountain"]

# See the result
print(mountain_reg)
```
```py
# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000 
# and region is Pacific
fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness['family_members'] < 1000) \
    & (homelessness['region']=='Pacific')]

# See the result
print(fam_lt_1k_pac)
```
## 🦍 Subsetting rows by categorical variables
- [x] 1). Filter homelessness for cases where the USA census region is "South Atlantic" or it is "Mid-Atlantic", assigning to south_mid_atlantic. View the printed result.
- [x] 2). Filter homelessness for cases where the USA census state is in the list of Mojave states, canu, assigning to mojave_homelessness. View the printed result. 
```py
# Subset for rows in South Atlantic or Mid-Atlantic regions
south_mid_atlantic = homelessness[(homelessness['region']=="South Atlantic") \
                                 | (homelessness['region']=="Mid-Atlantic")]

# See the result
print(south_mid_atlantic)
```
```py
# The Mojave Desert states
canu = ["California", "Arizona", "Nevada", "Utah"]

# Filter for rows in the Mojave Desert states
mojave_homelessness = homelessness[homelessness['state'].isin(canu)]

# See the result
print(mojave_homelessness)
```
## 📚 New columns
#### 🔽 add new column
❓ pass df['new_name'] = df['computed_col'] - 100

    dogs["height_m"] = dogs['height_cm'] / 100
    
    # doggy mass index BMI = wight_kg/(height_m)**2
    dog['bmi'] = dogs['wight_kg']/ dogs['height_m'] ** 2
    
    # multiple manipulatons
