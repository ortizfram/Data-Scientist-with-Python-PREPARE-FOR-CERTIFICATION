# Examining traffic violations
```py
# Count the unique values in 'violation'
print(ri.violation.value_counts(), '\n')

# Express the counts as proportions
print(ri.violation.value_counts(normalize=True))
```
# Comparing violations by gender
```py
# Create a DataFrame of female drivers
female = ri[ri.driver_gender == 'F']

# Create a DataFrame of male drivers
male = ri[ri.driver_gender == 'M']

# Compute the violations by female drivers (as proportions)
print('female violations %: \n', female.violation.value_counts(normalize=True), '\n')

# Compute the violations by male drivers (as proportions)
print('male violations %: \n', male.violation.value_counts(normalize=True))
```
# Filtering by multiple conditions
Which one of these commands would filter the ri DataFrame to only include female drivers who were stopped for a speeding violation?

      ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'F') & (ri.violation == 'Speeding')]
# Comparing speeding outcomes by gender
```py
# Create a DataFrame of female drivers stopped for speeding
female_and_speeding = ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'F') & (ri.violation == 'Speeding')]

# Create a DataFrame of male drivers stopped for speeding
male_and_speeding = ri[(ri.driver_gender == 'M') & (ri.violation == 'Speeding')]

# Compute the stop outcomes for female drivers (as proportions)
print(female_and_speeding.stop_outcome.value_counts(normalize=True), '\n')

# Compute the stop outcomes for male drivers (as proportions)
print(male_and_speeding.stop_outcome.value_counts(normalize=True))

# about 95% of stops for speeding result in a ticket. Thus, the data fails to show that gender has an impact on who gets a ticket for speeding.

# Calculating the search rate
```py
# Check the data type of 'search_conducted'
print(ri.search_conducted.dtype)

# Calculate the search rate by counting the values
print(ri.search_conducted.value_counts(normalize=True), '\n') # True     0.038

# Calculate the search rate by taking the mean
print(ri.search_conducted.mean())                             # 0.0382153092354627

# Comparing search rates by gender
```py

```py

print(ri[ri.driver_gender == 'M'].search_conducted.mean())
```
```py
# Calculate the search rate for both groups simultaneously

# Adding a second factor to the analysis
```py
# Calculate the search rate for each combination of gender and violation

```py
# Reverse the ordering to group by violation before gender
