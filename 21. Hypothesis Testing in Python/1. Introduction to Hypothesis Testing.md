# Uses of A/B testing
What is the main reason to use an A/B test?
- [x] provides a way to check outcomes of competing scenarios and decide which way to proceed.
# Calculating the sample mean
```py
# Print the late_shipments dataset
print(late_shipments)
```
```py
# Print the late_shipments dataset
print(late_shipments)

# Calculate the proportion of late shipments
late_prop_samp = (late_shipments['late'] == "Yes").mean()

# Print the results
print(late_prop_samp) # 0.061 or 6.1%.
```
# Criminal trials and hypothesis tests
Which of the following correctly matches up a criminal trial with properties of a hypothesis test?
- [x] Just as the defendant is initially assumed not guilty, the null hypothesis is first assumed to be true.
# Left tail, right tail, two tails

# Calculating p-values
#### Question
What type of test should be used for this alternative hypothesis?
- [x] Right-tailed
```py
# Calculate the z-score of late_prop_samp
z_score = (late_prop_samp - late_prop_hyp) / std_error

# Calculate the p-value
# from scipy.stats import norm
p_value = 1 - norm.cdf(z_score, loc=0, scale=1) # mean 0 and std 1
                 
# Print the p-value
print(p_value) # 0.44
```
# significance level
less than 5% rejection
# Decisions from p-values
- [x] If the , reject .
# Calculating a confidence interval
```py
# Calculate 95% confidence interval using quantile method
lower = np.quantile(late_shipments_boot_distn, 0.025)
upper = np.quantile(late_shipments_boot_distn, 0.975)

# Print the confidence interval
print((lower, upper))
```
#### Question
Does the confidence interval match up with the conclusion to stick with the original assumption that 6% is a reasonable value for the unknown population parameter?
- [x] Yes, since 0.06 is included in the 95% confidence interval and we failed to reject  due to a large p-value, the results are similar
