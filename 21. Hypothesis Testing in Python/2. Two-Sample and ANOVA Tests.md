```py
# Calculate the numerator of the test statistic
numerator = (xbar_no - xbar_yes)

# Calculate the denominator of the test statistic
denominator = np.sqrt((s_no ** 2 / n_no) + (s_yes **2 / n_yes))

# Calculate the test statistic
t_stat = numerator / denominator

# Print the test statistic
print(t_stat)
```
# Why is t needed?
In which hypothesis testing scenario is a t-distribution needed instead of the z-distribution?
- [x] When a sample standard deviation is used in estimating a standard error.
# The t-distribution
Which statement about the the t-distribution is true?
- [x] As you increase the degrees of freedom, the t-distribution PDF and CDF curves get closer to those of a normal distribution
# From t to p
#### Question
What type of test does the alternative hypothesis indicate that we need?
- [x] Left-tailed
```py
# Calculate the degrees of freedom
degrees_of_freedom = n_no + n_yes - 2

# Calculate the p-value from the test stat
p_value = t.cdf(t_stat, df=degrees_of_freedom)

# Print the p_value
print(p_value)
```
#### Question
What decision should you make based on the results of the hypothesis test?
- [x] Reject the null hypothesis.
# Is pairing needed?

# Visualizing the difference
```py
# Calculate the differences from 2012 to 2016
sample_dem_data['diff'] = sample_dem_data['dem_percent_12'] - sample_dem_data['dem_percent_16']

# Print sample_dem_data
print(sample_dem_data)
```
```py
# Calculate the differences from 2012 to 2016
sample_dem_data['diff'] = sample_dem_data['dem_percent_12'] - sample_dem_data['dem_percent_16']

# Find the mean of the diff column
xbar_diff = sample_dem_data['diff'].mean() # 6.829312660106834

# Print xbar_diff
print(xbar_diff)
```
