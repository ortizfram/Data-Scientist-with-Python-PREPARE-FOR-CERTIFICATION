```py
# Calculate the numerator of the test statistic
numerator = (xbar_no - xbar_yes)

# Calculate the denominator of the test statistic
denominator = np.sqrt((s_no ** 2 / n_no) + (s_yes **2 / n_yes))

# Calculate the test statistic
t_stat = numerator / denominator

# Print the test statistic
print(t_stat)
```
# Why is t needed?
In which hypothesis testing scenario is a t-distribution needed instead of the z-distribution?
- [x] When a sample standard deviation is used in estimating a standard error.
# The t-distribution
Which statement about the the t-distribution is true?
- [x] As you increase the degrees of freedom, the t-distribution PDF and CDF curves get closer to those of a normal distribution
# From t to p
#### Question
What type of test does the alternative hypothesis indicate that we need?
- [x] Left-tailed
```py
# Calculate the degrees of freedom
degrees_of_freedom = n_no + n_yes - 2

# Calculate the p-value from the test stat
p_value = t.cdf(t_stat, df=degrees_of_freedom)

# Print the p_value
print(p_value)
```
#### Question
What decision should you make based on the results of the hypothesis test?
- [x] Reject the null hypothesis.
# Is pairing needed?

# Visualizing the difference
```py
# Calculate the differences from 2012 to 2016
sample_dem_data['diff'] = sample_dem_data['dem_percent_12'] - sample_dem_data['dem_percent_16']

# Print sample_dem_data
print(sample_dem_data)
```
```py
# Calculate the differences from 2012 to 2016
sample_dem_data['diff'] = sample_dem_data['dem_percent_12'] - sample_dem_data['dem_percent_16']

# Find the mean of the diff column
xbar_diff = sample_dem_data['diff'].mean() # 6.829312660106834

# Print xbar_diff
print(xbar_diff)
```
```py
# Calculate the differences from 2012 to 2016
sample_dem_data['diff'] = sample_dem_data['dem_percent_12'] - sample_dem_data['dem_percent_16']

# Find the mean of the diff column
xbar_diff = sample_dem_data['diff'].mean()

# Using ttest()
```py
# Conduct a t-test on diff
test_results = pingouin.ttest(x= sample_dem_data['diff'],
                     y= 0,
                     alternative= "two-sided")


                              
# Print the test results
print(test_results)
```
#### Question
What's the correct decision from the t-test, assuming alpha=0.01?
- [x] Reject the null hypothesis.
```py
# Conduct a t-test on diff
test_results = pingouin.ttest(x=sample_dem_data['diff'], 
                              y=0, 
                              alternative="two-sided")

# Conduct a paired t-test on dem_percent_12 and dem_percent_16
paired_test_results = pingouin.ttest(x= sample_dem_data['dem_percent_12'],
                                     y= sample_dem_data['dem_percent_16'],
                                     paired=True,
                                     alternative='two-sided')



                              
# Print the paired test results
print(paired_test_results)
```
#### Question
Compare the paired t-test to an (inappropriate) unpaired test on the same data. How does the p-value change?

    pingouin.ttest(x=sample_dem_data['dem_percent_12'], 
                   y=sample_dem_data['dem_percent_16'], 
                   alternative="two-sided")
- [x] The p-value from the unpaired test is greater than than the p-value from the paired test.

# Question
Assuming a significance level of 0.1, should you reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in pack prices between shipment modes?
- [x] Yes. The p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, so the null hypothesis should be rejected.
> There is a significant difference in pack prices between the shipment modes. However, we don't know which shipment modes this applies to.
```py
              Source  ddof1  ddof2       F      p-unc    np2
    0  shipment_mode      2    997  21.865  5.089e-10  0.042
```
# Pairwise t-tests
 ANOVA test didn't tell you which categories of shipment mode had significant differences in pack prices
```py
# Perform a pairwise t-test on pack price, grouped by shipment mode
pairwise_results = pingouin.pairwise_tests(data = late_shipments,
                                           dv = 'pack_price',
                                           between = 'shipment_mode') 

# Print pairwise_results
print(pairwise_results)
```
```py
# Modify the pairwise t-tests to use Bonferroni p-value adjustment
pairwise_results = pingouin.pairwise_tests(data=late_shipments, 
                                           dv="pack_price",
                                           between="shipment_mode",
                                           padjust="bonf")

# Print pairwise_results
print(pairwise_results)
```
#### Question
Using the Bonferroni correction results and assuming a significance level of 0.1, for which pairs of shipment modes should you reject the null hypothesis that the pack prices are equal?
- [x] "Ocean" and "Air Charter"; "Ocean" and "Air"; "Air Charter" and "Air".
