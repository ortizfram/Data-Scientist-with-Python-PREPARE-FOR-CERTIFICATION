# t for proportions?
Some of the hypothesis tests in this course have used a  test statistic and some have used a  test statistic. To get the correct p-value, you need to use the right type of test statistic.

Do tests of proportion(s) use a  or a  test statistic and why?
- [x] z : The test statistic for proportion(s) has only one estimate of a parameter instead of two.
# Test for single proportions
```py
# Hypothesize that the proportion of late shipments is 6%
p_0 = 0.06

# Calculate the sample proportion of late shipments
p_hat = (late_shipments['late'] == "Yes").mean()

# Calculate the sample size
n = len(late_shipments)

# Print p_hat and n
print(p_hat, n) # 0.061 1000
```
```py
# Hypothesize that the proportion of late shipments is 6%
p_0 = 0.06

# Calculate the sample proportion of late shipments
p_hat = (late_shipments['late'] == "Yes").mean()

# Calculate the sample size
n = len(late_shipments)

# Calculate the numerator and denominator of the test statistic
numerator = (p_hat - p_0)
denominator = np.sqrt(p_0 * (1- p_0) / n)

# Calculate the test statistic
z_score = numerator / denominator

# Print the result
print(z_score) # 0.13315591032282698
