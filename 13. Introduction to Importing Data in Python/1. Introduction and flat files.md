# Exploring your working directory
In order to import data into Python, you should first have an idea of what files are in your working directory.

IPython, which is running on DataCamp's servers, has a bunch of cool commands, including its magic commands. For example, starting a line with ! gives you complete system shell access. This means that the IPython magic command ! ls will display the contents of your current directory. Your task is to use the IPython magic command ! ls to check out the contents of your current directory and answer the following question: which of the following files is in your working directory?

      # IPython SHELL
      !ls
# Importing entire text files
In this exercise, you'll be working with the file moby_dick.txt. It is a text file that contains the opening sentences of Moby Dick, one of the great American novels! Here you'll get experience opening a text file, printing its contents to the shell and, finally, closing it.

- [x] Open the file moby_dick.txt as read-only and store it in the variable file. Make sure to pass the filename enclosed in quotation marks ''.
- [x] Print the contents of the file to the shell using the print() function. As Hugo showed in the video, you'll need to apply the method read() to the object file.
- [x] Check whether the file is closed by executing print(file.closed).
- [x] Close the file using the close() method.
- [x] Check again that the file is closed as you did above.
```py
# Open a file: file
file = open("moby_dick.txt", mode="r")

# Print it
print(file.read())

# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed) # asking

# Close file
file.close()

# Check whether file is closed
print(file.closed) # asking
```
