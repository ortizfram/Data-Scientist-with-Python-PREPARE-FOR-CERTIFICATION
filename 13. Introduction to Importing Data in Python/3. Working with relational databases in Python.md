# ==> Creating a database engine in Python
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite')
```
## --> getting table names
    engine.table_names()
# Creating a database engine
```py
# Import necessary module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')
```
# What are the tables in the database?
In this exercise, you'll once again create an engine to connect to 'Chinook.sqlite'. Before you can get any data out of the database, however, you'll need to know what tables it contains!

To this end, you'll save the table names to a list using the method table_names() on the engine and then you will print the list.

```py
# Import necessary module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

table_names = engine.table_names()

# Print the table names to the shell
print(table_names)
```
    ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']
# ==> SQL query
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite') 
con engine.connect() # connection
rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Orders") # query
df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall()) # save
con.close()
```
## --> connect engine using context manager
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite') 
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT orderID, orderDate, shipName  FROM Orders") # query
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchmany(size=5)) # 5 rows instead of all
    df.columns = rs.keys()
con.close()
```
# The Hello World of SQL Queries!
- [x] Open the engine connection as con using the method connect() on the engine.
- [x] Execute the query that selects ALL columns from the Album table. Store the results in rs.
- [x] Store all of your query results in the DataFrame df by applying the fetchall() method to the results rs.
- [x] Close the connection!
```py
# Import packages
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine connection: con
con = engine.connect()

# Perform query: rs
rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Album")

# Save results of the query to DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())

# Close connection
con.close()

# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```
# Customizing the Hello World of SQL Queries

- [x] Using the rs object, set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.
```py
# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT LastName, Title FROM Employee")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchmany(size=3))
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print the length of the DataFrame df
print(len(df))

# Print the head of the DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```
# Filtering your database records using SQL's WHERE
- [x] Complete the argument of create_engine() so that the engine for the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite' is created.
- [x] Execute the query that selects all records from the Employee table where 'EmployeeId' is greater than or equal to 6. Use the >= operator and assign the results to rs.
- [x] Apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
- [x] Using the rs object, set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.
```py
# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeId >= 6")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print the head of the DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```
# Ordering your SQL records with ORDER BY
- [x] Using the function create_engine(), create an engine for the SQLite database Chinook.sqlite and assign it to the variable engine.
- [x] In the context manager, execute the query that selects all records from the Employee table and orders them in increasing order by the column BirthDate. Assign the result to rs.
- [x] In a call to pd.DataFrame(), apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
- [x] Set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.
```py
# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine in context manager
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY BirthDate")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())

    # Set the DataFrame's column names
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
```
# ==> Querying relational databases with pandas
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite')
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Orders")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    df.columns = rs.keys()
```
`oneline code`
```py
pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM Orders", engine)
```
# Pandas and The Hello World of SQL Queries!
- Import the pandas package using the alias pd.
- Using the function create_engine(), create an engine for the SQLite database Chinook.sqlite and assign it to the variable engine.
- Use the pandas function read_sql_query() to assign to the variable df the DataFrame of results from the following query: select all records from the table Album.
- The remainder of the code is included to confirm that the DataFrame created by this method is equal to that created by the previous method that you learned.
```py
# Import packages
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite")

# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM Album", engine)

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Open engine in context manager and store query result in df1
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Album")
    df1 = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    df1.columns = rs.keys()

# Confirm that both methods yield the same result
print(df.equals(df1))
```
    True
# Pandas for more complex querying
- Using the function create_engine(), create an engine for the SQLite database Chinook.sqlite and assign it to the variable engine.
- Use the pandas function read_sql_query() to assign to the variable df the DataFrame of results from the following query: select all records from the Employee table where the EmployeeId is greater than or equal to 6 and ordered by BirthDate (make sure to use WHERE and ORDER BY in this precise order).
```py
# Import packages
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite")

# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeId >= 6 ORDER BY BirthDate", engine)

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
```
# ==> Advanced querying: exploiting table relationships
## --> inner join in pandas
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
engine = crete_engine("sqlite:///Northind.sqlite")
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT OrderId, CompanyName FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Order.CustomersId = Customers.CustomersId", engine)
print()
```
# The power of SQL lies in relationships between tables: INNER JOIN
- Assign to rs the results from the following query: select all the records, extracting the Title of the record and Name of the artist of each record from the Album table and the Artist table, respectively. To do so, INNER JOIN these two tables on the ArtistID column of both.
- In a call to pd.DataFrame(), apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
- Set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.
```py
# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT Title, Name FROM Album INNER JOIN Artist on Album.ArtistID = Artist.ArtistID")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```
# Filtering your INNER JOIN
- Use the pandas function read_sql_query() to assign to the variable df the DataFrame of results from the following query: select all records from PlaylistTrack INNER JOIN Track on PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId that satisfy the condition Milliseconds < 250000.
```py
# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM PlaylistTrack INNER JOIN Track on PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId WHERE Milliseconds < 250000", engine)

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
```
