- Possible Answers
- [ ] Each row or record in a table represents an instance of an entity type.
- [ ] Each column in a table represents an attribute or feature of an instance.
- [ ] Every table contains a primary key column, which has a unique entry for each row.
- [x] A database consists of at least 3 tables.
- [ ] There are relations between tables.
# ==> Creating a database engine in Python
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite')
```
## --> getting table names
    engine.table_names()
# Creating a database engine
```py
# Import necessary module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')
```
# What are the tables in the database?
In this exercise, you'll once again create an engine to connect to 'Chinook.sqlite'. Before you can get any data out of the database, however, you'll need to know what tables it contains!

To this end, you'll save the table names to a list using the method table_names() on the engine and then you will print the list.

- [x] Import the function create_engine from the module sqlalchemy.
- [x] Create an engine to connect to the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite' and assign it to engine.
- [x] Using the method table_names() on the engine engine, assign the table names of 'Chinook.sqlite' to the variable table_names.
- [x] Print the object table_names to the shell.
```py
# Import necessary module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Save the table names to a list: table_names
table_names = engine.table_names()

# Print the table names to the shell
print(table_names)
```
    ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']
# ==> SQL query
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite') 
con engine.connect() # connection
rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Orders") # query
df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall()) # save
con.close()
```
## --> connect engine using context manager
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite') 
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT orderID, orderDate, shipName  FROM Orders") # query
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchmany(size=5)) # 5 rows instead of all
    df.columns = rs.keys()
con.close()
```
# The Hello World of SQL Queries!
- [x] Open the engine connection as con using the method connect() on the engine.
- [x] Execute the query that selects ALL columns from the Album table. Store the results in rs.
- [x] Store all of your query results in the DataFrame df by applying the fetchall() method to the results rs.
- [x] Close the connection!
```py
# Import packages
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine connection: con
con = engine.connect()

# Perform query: rs
rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Album")

# Save results of the query to DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())

# Close connection
con.close()

# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```
# Customizing the Hello World of SQL Queries
- [x] Execute the SQL query that selects the columns LastName and Title from the Employee table. Store the results in the variable rs.
- [x] Apply the method fetchmany() to rs in order to retrieve 3 of the records. Store them in the DataFrame df.
- [x] Using the rs object, set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.
```py
# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT LastName, Title FROM Employee")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchmany(size=3))
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print the length of the DataFrame df
print(len(df))

# Print the head of the DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```
# Filtering your database records using SQL's WHERE
- [x] Complete the argument of create_engine() so that the engine for the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite' is created.
- [x] Execute the query that selects all records from the Employee table where 'EmployeeId' is greater than or equal to 6. Use the >= operator and assign the results to rs.
- [x] Apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
- [x] Using the rs object, set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.
```py
# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeId >= 6")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print the head of the DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```
# Ordering your SQL records with ORDER BY
- [x] Using the function create_engine(), create an engine for the SQLite database Chinook.sqlite and assign it to the variable engine.
- [x] In the context manager, execute the query that selects all records from the Employee table and orders them in increasing order by the column BirthDate. Assign the result to rs.
- [x] In a call to pd.DataFrame(), apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
- [x] Set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding names of the table columns.
```py
# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine in context manager
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY BirthDate")
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())

    # Set the DataFrame's column names
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
```
