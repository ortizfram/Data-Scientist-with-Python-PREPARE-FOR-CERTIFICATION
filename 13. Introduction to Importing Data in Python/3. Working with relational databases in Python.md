- Possible Answers
- [ ] Each row or record in a table represents an instance of an entity type.
- [ ] Each column in a table represents an attribute or feature of an instance.
- [ ] Every table contains a primary key column, which has a unique entry for each row.
- [x] A database consists of at least 3 tables.
- [ ] There are relations between tables.
# ==> Creating a database engine in Python
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite')
```
## --> getting table names
    engine.table_names()
# Creating a database engine
```py
# Import necessary module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')
```
# What are the tables in the database?
In this exercise, you'll once again create an engine to connect to 'Chinook.sqlite'. Before you can get any data out of the database, however, you'll need to know what tables it contains!

To this end, you'll save the table names to a list using the method table_names() on the engine and then you will print the list.

- [x] Import the function create_engine from the module sqlalchemy.
- [x] Create an engine to connect to the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite' and assign it to engine.
- [x] Using the method table_names() on the engine engine, assign the table names of 'Chinook.sqlite' to the variable table_names.
- [x] Print the object table_names to the shell.
```py
# Import necessary module
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Save the table names to a list: table_names
table_names = engine.table_names()

# Print the table names to the shell
print(table_names)
```
    ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']
# ==> SQL query
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite') 
con engine.connect() # connection
rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Orders") # query
df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall()) # save
con.close()
```
## --> connect engine using context manager
```py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Northwind.sqlite') 
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute("SELECT orderID, orderDate, shipName  FROM Orders") # query
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchmany(size=5)) # 5 rows instead of all
    df.columns = rs.keys()
con.close()
```
# The Hello World of SQL Queries!
- [x] Open the engine connection as con using the method connect() on the engine.
- [x] Execute the query that selects ALL columns from the Album table. Store the results in rs.
- [x] Store all of your query results in the DataFrame df by applying the fetchall() method to the results rs.
- [x] Close the connection!
```py
# Import packages
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')

# Open engine connection: con
con = engine.connect()

# Perform query: rs
rs = con.execute("SELECT * FROM Album")

# Save results of the query to DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())

# Close connection
con.close()

# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())
```
