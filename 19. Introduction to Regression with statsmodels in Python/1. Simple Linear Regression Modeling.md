# Which one is the response variable?
- Print taiwan_real_estate in the console to view the dataset, and decide which variable would make a good response variable.
- ANSW: price_twd_msq --> `House price per unit area, in New Taiwan dollars per meter squared.`

```py
# Import seaborn with alias sns
import seaborn as sns

# Import matplotlib.pyplot with alias plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Draw the scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(y = 'price_twd_msq',\
                x = 'n_convenience',\
                data = taiwan_real_estate)

# Show the plot

```py
# Draw a trend line on the scatter plot of price_twd_msq vs. n_convenience
sns.regplot(x = "n_convenience",

         data = taiwan_real_estate,

# Estimate the intercept
- Click the plot, then estimate the intercept of the linear regression trend line.
- ANSW: 8.22
# Estimate the slope
- This time, estimate the slope of the trend line. Click the line once, then double click a different position on the line, and finally, read the slope value.
- ANSW: 0.8
# Linear regression with ols()
```py
# Import the ols function
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols

# Create the model object
mdl_price_vs_conv = ols("price_twd_msq ~ n_convenience", data=taiwan_real_estate)

# Fit the model
mdl_price_vs_conv = mdl_price_vs_conv.fit()

# Print the parameters of the fitted model
print(mdl_price_vs_conv.params)

- **Question**

The model had an Intercept coefficient of 8.2242. What does this mean?
- ANSW: On average, a house with zero convenience stores nearby had a price of 8.2242 TWD per square meter.
- **Question**

The model had an n_convenience coefficient of 0.7981. What does this mean?
- ANSW: If you increase the number of nearby convenience stores by one, then the expected increase in house price is 0.7981 TWD per square meter.
