- Question : 

mdl_click_vs_impression_orig has a coefficient of determination of 0.89. Which statement about the model is true?
- ANSW: The number of impressions explains 89% of the variability in the number of clicks.
- Question : 

Which model does the coefficient of determination suggest gives a better fit?
- ANSW: The transformed model, mdl_click_vs_impression_trans.
# Residual standard error
```py
# Calculate mse_orig for mdl_click_vs_impression_orig
mse_orig = mdl_click_vs_impression_orig.mse_resid

# Calculate rse_orig for mdl_click_vs_impression_orig and print it
rse_orig = np.sqrt(mse_orig)
print("RSE of original model: ", rse_orig)

# Calculate mse_trans for mdl_click_vs_impression_trans
mse_trans = mdl_click_vs_impression_trans.mse_resid

# Calculate rse_trans for mdl_click_vs_impression_trans and print it
rse_trans = np.sqrt(mse_trans)
print("RSE of transformed model: ", rse_trans)
```
