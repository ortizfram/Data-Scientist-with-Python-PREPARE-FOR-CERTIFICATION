- Question : 

mdl_click_vs_impression_orig has a coefficient of determination of 0.89. Which statement about the model is true?
- ANSW: The number of impressions explains 89% of the variability in the number of clicks.
- Question : 

Which model does the coefficient of determination suggest gives a better fit?
- ANSW: The transformed model, mdl_click_vs_impression_trans.
# Residual standard error
```py
# Calculate mse_orig for mdl_click_vs_impression_orig
mse_orig = mdl_click_vs_impression_orig.mse_resid

# Calculate rse_orig for mdl_click_vs_impression_orig and print it
rse_orig = np.sqrt(mse_orig)
print("RSE of original model: ", rse_orig)

# Calculate mse_trans for mdl_click_vs_impression_trans
mse_trans = mdl_click_vs_impression_trans.mse_resid

# Calculate rse_trans for mdl_click_vs_impression_trans and print it
rse_trans = np.sqrt(mse_trans)
print("RSE of transformed model: ", rse_trans)
```
**Question**

mdl_click_vs_impression_orig has an RSE of about 20. Which statement is true?
- ANSW: The typical difference between observed number of clicks and predicted number of clicks is 20.

**Question**

Which model does the RSE suggest gives more accurate predictions? mdl_click_vs_impression_orig has an RSE of about 20, mdl_click_vs_impression_trans has an RSE of about 0.2.
- ANSW: The transformed model, mdl_click_vs_impression_trans.

# Residuals vs. fitted values
- Look at the numbers on the y-axis scales and how well the trend lines follow the  line. Which statement is true?

- ANSW: The residuals track the  line more closely in the transformed model compared to the original model, indicating that the transformed model is a better fit for the data.
# Q-Q plot of residuals
Look at how well the points track the "normality" line. Which statement is true?
- ANSW: The residuals track the "normality" line more closely in the transformed model compared to the original model, indicating that the transformed model is a better fit for the dat
# Scale-location
Look at the numbers on the y-axis and the slope of the trend line. Which statement is true?
- ANSW: The size of the standardized residuals is more consistent in the transformed model compared to the original model, indicating that the transformed model is a better fit for the data.
