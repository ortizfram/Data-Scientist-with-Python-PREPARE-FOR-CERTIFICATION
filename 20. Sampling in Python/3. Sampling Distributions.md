# Relative error vs. sample size
Which statement about relative errors and sample sizes is true?
- [x] For small sample sizes, each additional entry in a sample can result in substantial decreases to the relative error
> As you increase the sample size, the relative error decreases quickly at first, then more slowly as it drops to zero.

# Create an empty list
mean_attritions = []
# Loop 500 times to create 500 sample means
for x in range(500):
	mean_attritions.append(
    	attrition_pop.sample(n=60)['Attrition'].mean()
	)
  
# Print out the first few entries of the list
print(mean_attritions[0:5])
```
```py
# Create an empty list
mean_attritions = []
# Loop 500 times to create 500 sample means
for i in range(500):
	mean_attritions.append(
    	attrition_pop.sample(n=60)['Attrition'].mean()

# Replication parameters
Which statement about the effect of each parameter on the distribution of sample means is true?
- [x] As the sample size increases, the range of calculated sample means tends to decrease.
> As sample size increases, on average each sample mean has a lower relative error compared to the population mean

  # Exact vs. approximate
You've seen two types of sampling distribution now (exact and approximate). It's really important to understand when each should be computed.

Should we always be able to compute the exact sampling distribution directly?
- [x] No, the computational time and resources needed to look at the population of values could be too much for our problem.
# Population & sampling distribution means
```py
  # Calculate the mean of the mean attritions for each sampling distribution
mean_of_means_5 = np.mean(sampling_distribution_5)
mean_of_means_50 = np.mean(sampling_distribution_50)
mean_of_means_500 = np.mean(sampling_distribution_500)

# Print the results
print(mean_of_means_5)
print(mean_of_means_50)
print(mean_of_means_500)
  ```
#### Question
How does sample size affect the mean of the sample means?
- [x] Regardless of sample size, the mean of the sampling distribution is a close approximation to the population mean.
# Population & sampling distribution variation
```py
# Calculate the std. dev. of the mean attritions for each sampling distribution
sd_of_means_5 = np.std(sampling_distribution_5, ddof=1)
sd_of_means_50 = np.std(sampling_distribution_50, ddof=1)
sd_of_means_500 = np.std(sampling_distribution_500, ddof=1)

# Print the results
print(sd_of_means_5)
print(sd_of_means_50)
print(sd_of_means_500)

'''
#### Question
How are the standard deviations of the sampling distributions related to the population standard deviation and the sample size?
- [x] The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is approximately equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.
