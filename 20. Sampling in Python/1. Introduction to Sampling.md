# Reasons for sampling
- Which of the following is *not* a good scenario to use sampling?
- [x] You've finished collecting data on a small study of the wing measurements for 10 butterflies.

**bad choise for small datasets**
# Simple sampling with pandas
```py
# Sample 1000 rows from spotify_population
spotify_sample = spotify_population.sample(n=1000)

# Print the sample
print(spotify_sample)
```
```py
# Sample 1000 rows from spotify_population
spotify_sample = spotify_population.sample(n=1000)

# Print the sample
print(spotify_sample)

# Calculate the mean duration in mins from spotify_population
mean_dur_pop = spotify_population['duration_minutes'].mean()

# Calculate the mean duration in mins from spotify_sample
mean_dur_samp = spotify_sample['duration_minutes'].mean()

# Print the means
print(mean_dur_pop) # 3.8521
print(mean_dur_samp)# 3.8277
```
# Simple sampling and calculating with NumPy
```py
# Subset the loudness column of spotify_population
loudness_pop = spotify_population.loudness

# Sample 100 values of loudness_pop
loudness_samp = loudness_pop.sample(n=100)

# Print the sample
print(loudness_samp)
```
```py
# Create a pandas Series from the loudness column of spotify_population
loudness_pop = spotify_population['loudness']

# Sample 100 values of loudness_pop
loudness_samp = loudness_pop.sample(n=100)

# Calculate the mean of loudness_pop
mean_loudness_pop = np.mean(loudness_pop)

# Calculate the mean of loudness_samp
mean_loudness_samp = np.mean(loudness_samp)

# Print the means
print(mean_loudness_pop) # -7.36685
print(mean_loudness_samp)# -7.50746
```
# Are findings from the sample generalizable?
```py
# Visualize the distribution of acousticness with a histogram
spotify_population.hist('acousticness',bins=np.arange(0,1.01,0.01))
plt.show()
```

```py
# Update the histogram to use spotify_mysterious_sample
spotify_mysterious_sample['acousticness'].hist(bins=np.arange(0, 1.01, 0.01))
plt.show()
```

- Question

Compare the two histograms you drew. Are the acousticness values in the sample generalizable to the general population?
- [x] No. The acousticness samples are consistently higher than those in the general population.
