# ==> Reading date and time data in Pandas
## --> loading datetimes w/ parse dates
- arg `parse_dates` in pd.read_csv() :
```py

                    parse_dates=['start_date','end_date'])

# select start_date for row 2
rides['start_date'].iloc[2]
```
# Loading a csv file in Pandas
- Import Pandas.
- Complete the call to read_csv() so that it correctly parses the date columns Start date and End date
```py
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV into the rides variable
rides = pd.read_csv('capital-onebike.csv', 
                    parse_dates = ['Start date','End date'])

# Print the initial (0th) row
print(rides.iloc[0])
```
# Making timedelta columns
- Subtract the Start date column from the End date column to get a Series of timedeltas; assign the result to ride_durations.
- Convert ride_durations into seconds and assign the result to the 'Duration' column of rides.
```py
# Subtract the start date from the end date
ride_durations = rides['End date'] - rides['Start date']

# Convert the results to seconds
rides['Duration'] = ride_durations.dt.total_seconds()

print(rides['Duration'].head())

# How many joyrides?
- Create a Pandas Series which is True when Start station and End station are the same, and assign the result to joyrides.
- Calculate the median duration of all rides.
- Calculate the median duration of joyrides.
```py
# Create joyrides
joyrides = (rides['Start station'] == rides['End station'])

# Total number of joyrides
print("{} rides were joyrides".format(joyrides.sum()))

# Median of all rides
print("The median duration overall was {:.2f} seconds"\
      .format(rides['Duration'].median()))

# Median of joyrides
print("The median duration for joyrides was {:.2f} seconds"\
      .format(rides[joyrides]['Duration'].median()))

6 rides were joyrides
The median duration overall was 660.00 seconds
The median duration for joyrides was 2642.50 seconds

# It's getting cold outside, W20529
- Resample rides to the daily level, based on the Start date column.
- Plot the .size() of each result
```py
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Resample rides to daily, take the size, plot the results
rides.resample('D', on = 'Start date')\
  .size()\
  .plot(ylim = [0, 15])

# Show the results
plt.show()
```

- Since the daily time series is so noisy for this one bike, change the resampling to be monthly.
```py
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Resample rides to monthly, take the size, plot the results
rides.resample('M', on = 'Start date')\
  .size()\
  .plot(ylim = [0, 150])

# Show the results
plt.show()

# Members vs casual riders over time
- Set monthly_rides to be a resampled version of rides, by month, based on start date.
- Use the method .value_counts() to find out how many Member and Casual rides there were, and divide them by the total number of rides per month.
```py
# Resample rides to be monthly on the basis of Start date
monthly_rides = rides.resample('M', on='Start date')['Member type']

# Take the ratio of the .value_counts() over the total number of rides
print(monthly_rides.value_counts() / monthly_rides.size())

# Combining groupby() and resample()
- Complete the .groupby() call to group by 'Member type', and the .resample() call to resample according to 'Start date', by month.
- Print the median Duration for each group.
```py
# Group rides by member type, and resample to the month
grouped = rides.groupby('Member type')\
  .resample('M', on='Start date')

# Print the median duration for each group
print(grouped['Duration'].median())

# ==> Additional datetime methods in Pandas
## --> timezones in pandas
```py
rides['start date'].head(3)\
.dt.tz_localize('America/New_York")
```
## --> ambiguous datatimes
- arg `ambiguous='NaT'`
```py
# Handle ambiguous datetimes
rides['Start date'] = rides['start date']\
  .dt.tz_localize('America/New_York', ambiguous= 'NaT')
rides['End date'] = rides[ End date']\
  .dt.tz_localize('America/New_York', ambiguous = "NaT )

```
### > year of 1st 3 rows
```py
rides['Start date']\
  .head(3)\
  .dt.year
```
### > see weekday of 1st 3 rows
```py
rides['Start date']\
  .head(3)\
  .dt.day_name()
```
# Timezones in Pandas
- Make the Start date column timezone aware by localizing it to 'America/New_York' while ignoring any ambiguous datetimes.
```py
# Localize the Start date column to America/New_York
rides['Start date'] = rides['Start date'].dt.tz_localize('America/New_York',
                                                         ambiguous='NaT')

# Print first value
print(rides['Start date'].iloc[0])
```
- Now switch the Start date column to the timezone 'Europe/London' using the .dt.tz_convert() method.
> dt.tz_convert() converts to a new timezone, whereas dt.tz_localize() sets a timezone in the first place

```py
# Localize the Start date column to America/New_York
rides['Start date'] = rides['Start date'].dt.tz_localize('America/New_York', ambiguous='NaT')

# Print first value
print(rides['Start date'].iloc[0])

# Convert the Start date column to Europe/London
rides['Start date'] = rides['Start date'].dt.tz_convert('Europe/London')

# Print the new value
print(rides['Start date'].iloc[0])
```
# How long per weekday?
- Add a new column to rides called 'Ride start weekday', which is the weekday of the Start date.
- Print the median ride duration for each weekday.
```py
# Add a column for the weekday of the start of the ride
rides['Ride start weekday'] = rides['Start date'].dt.day_name()

# Print the median trip time per weekday
print(rides.groupby('Ride start weekday')['Duration'].median())
```
# How long between rides?
- Calculate the difference in the Start date of the current row and the End date of the previous row and assign it to rides['Time since'].
- Convert rides['Time since'] to seconds to make it easier to work with.
- Resample rides to be in monthly buckets according to the Start date.
- Divide the average by (60*60) to get the number of hours on average that W20529 waited in the dock before being picked up again.
```py
# Shift the index of the end date up one; now subract it from the start date
rides['Time since'] = rides['Start date'] - (rides['End date'].shift(1))

# Move from a timedelta to a number of seconds, which is easier to work with
rides['Time since'] = rides['Time since'].dt.total_seconds()

# Resample to the month
monthly = rides.resample('M', on='Start date')

# Print the average hours between rides each month
print(monthly['Time since'].mean() / (60*60))
```
