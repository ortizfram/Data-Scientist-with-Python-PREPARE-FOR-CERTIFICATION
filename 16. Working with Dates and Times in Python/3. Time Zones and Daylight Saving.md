# ==> UTC offsets
```py
# Import relevant classes
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# US Eastern Standard time zone
ET = timezone(timedelta(hours=-5))
# Timezone-aware datetime
dt = datetime(2017, 12, 30, 15, 9, 3, tzinfo= ET)
print (dt)
# 2017-12-30 15:09:03-05:00
```
- `.astimezone()` : from UTC to ST
```py
# India Standard time zone
IST = timezone (timedelta(hours =5, minutes=50))
# Convert to IST
print(dt.astimezone(IST))
# 2017-12-31 01:39:03+05:30  '''same moment different clock'''
```
# Creating timezone aware datetimes
- Import timezone.
- Set the tzinfo to UTC, without using timedelta.
```py
# Import datetime, timezone
from datetime import datetime, timezone

# October 1, 2017 at 15:26:26, UTC
dt = datetime(2017, 10, 1, 15, 26, 26, tzinfo=timezone.utc)

# Print results
print(dt.isoformat())
```
- Set pst to be a timezone set for UTC-8.
- Set dt's timezone to be pst
```py
# Import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# Create a timezone for Pacific Standard Time, or UTC-8
pst = timezone(timedelta(hours=-8))

# October 1, 2017 at 15:26:26, UTC-8
dt = datetime(2017, 10, 1, 15, 26, 26, tzinfo=pst)

# Print results
print(dt.isoformat()) # 2017-10-01T15:26:26+08:00
```
- Set aedt to be a timezone set for UTC+11.
- Set dt's timezone to be aedt.
```py
# Import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# Create a timezone for Australian Eastern Daylight Time, or UTC+11
aedt = timezone(timedelta(hours=11))

# October 1, 2017 at 15:26:26, UTC+11
dt = datetime(2017, 10, 1, 15, 26, 26, tzinfo=aedt)

# Print results
print(dt.isoformat()) #     2017-10-01T15:26:26-08:00
```
# Setting timezones
- Create edt, a timezone object whose UTC offset is -4 hours.
- Within the for loop:
- Set the tzinfo for trip['start'].
- Set the tzinfo for trip['end'].
```py
# Create a timezone object corresponding to UTC-4
edt = timezone(timedelta(hours=-4))

# Loop over trips, updating the start and end datetimes to be in UTC-4
for trip in onebike_datetimes[:10]:
  # Update trip['start'] and trip['end']
  trip['start'] = trip['start'].replace(tzinfo=edt)
  trip['end'] = trip['end'].replace(tzinfo=edt)
```
# What time did the bike leave in UTC?
- Within the for loop, move dt to be in UTC. Use timezone.utc as a convenient shortcut for UTC.
```py
# Loop over the trips
for trip in onebike_datetimes[:10] :
  # Pull out the start
  dt = trip['start']
  # Move dt to be in UTC
  dt = dt.astimezone(timezone.utc)
  
  # Print the start time in UTC
  print('Original:', trip['start'], '| UTC:', dt.isoformat())
  ```
# ==> Time zone database
# Putting the bike trips into the right time zone
- Import tz from dateutil.
- Assign et to be the timezone 'America/New_York'.
- Within the for loop, set start and end to have et as their timezone (use .replace()).
```py
# Import tz
from dateutil import tz

# Create a timezone object for Eastern Time
et = tz.gettz('America/New_York')

# Loop over trips, updating the datetimes to be in Eastern Time
for trip in onebike_datetimes[:10]:
  # Update trip['start'] and trip['end']
  trip['start'] = trip['start'].replace(tzinfo=et)
  trip['end'] = trip['end'].replace(tzinfo=et)
```
# What time did the bike leave? (Global edition)
- Set uk to be the timezone for the UK: 'Europe/London'.
- Change local to be in the uk timezone and assign it to notlocal.
```py
# Create the timezone object
uk = tz.gettz('Europe/London')

# Pull out the start of the first trip
local = onebike_datetimes[0]['start']

# What time was it in the UK?
notlocal = local.astimezone(uk)

# Print them out and see the difference
print(local.isoformat())
print(notlocal.isoformat())
```
- Set ist to be the timezone for India: 'Asia/Kolkata'.
- Change local to be in the ist timezone and assign it to notlocal.
```py
# Create the timezone object
ist = tz.gettz('Asia/Kolkata')

# Pull out the start of the first trip
local = onebike_datetimes[0]['start']

# What time was it in India?
notlocal = local.astimezone(ist)

# Print them out and see the difference
print(local.isoformat())
print(notlocal.isoformat())
```
- Set sm to be the timezone for Samoa: 'Pacific/Apia'.
- Change local to be in the sm timezone and assign it to notlocal.
```py
# Create the timezone object
sm = tz.gettz('Pacific/Apia')

# Pull out the start of the first trip
local = onebike_datetimes[0]['start']

# What time was it in Samoa?
notlocal = local.astimezone(sm)

# Print them out and see the difference
print(local.isoformat())
print(notlocal.isoformat())
```
# ==> Starting daylight saving time
# How many hours elapsed around daylight saving?
- You already have a datetime called start, set for March 12, 2017 at midnight, set to the timezone 'America/New_York'.
- Add six hours to start and assign it to end. Look at the UTC offset for the two results.
```py
# Import datetime, timedelta, tz, timezone
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from dateutil import tz

# Start on March 12, 2017, midnight, then add 6 hours
start = datetime(2017, 3, 12, tzinfo = tz.gettz('America/New_York'))
end = start + timedelta(hours=6)
print(start.isoformat() + " to " + end.isoformat())
```
- You added 6 hours, and got 6 AM, despite the fact that the clocks springing forward means only 5 hours would have actually elapsed!
- Calculate the time between start and end. How much time does Python think has elapsed?
```py
# Import datetime, timedelta, tz, timezone
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from dateutil import tz

# Start on March 12, 2017, midnight, then add 6 hours
start = datetime(2017, 3, 12, tzinfo = tz.gettz('America/New_York'))
end = start + timedelta(hours=6)
print(start.isoformat() + " to " + end.isoformat())

# How many hours have elapsed?
print((end - start).seconds/(60*60)) #  6.0
```
- Move your datetime objects into UTC and calculate the elapsed time again.
- Once you're in UTC, what result do you get?
```py
# Import datetime, timedelta, tz, timezone
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from dateutil import tz

# Start on March 12, 2017, midnight, then add 6 hours
start = datetime(2017, 3, 12, tzinfo = tz.gettz('America/New_York'))
end = start + timedelta(hours=6)
print(start.isoformat() + " to " + end.isoformat())

# How many hours have elapsed?
print((end - start).total_seconds()/(60*60))

# What if we move to UTC?
print((end.astimezone(timezone.utc) - start.astimezone(timezone.utc))\
      .total_seconds()/(60*60))
# 6.0
# 5.0
```
# March 29, throughout a decade
- Using tz, set the timezone for dt to be 'Europe/London'.
- Within the for loop:
- Use the .replace() method to change the year for dt to be y.
- Call .isoformat() on the result to observe the results.
```py
# Import datetime and tz
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil import tz

# Create starting date
dt = datetime(2000, 3, 29, tzinfo = tz.gettz('Europe/London'))

# Loop over the dates, replacing the year, and print the ISO timestamp
for y in range(2000, 2011):
  print(dt.replace(year=y).isoformat())
```
# ==> Ending daylight saving time
# Finding ambiguous datetimes
- Loop over the trips in onebike_datetimes:
  - Print any rides whose start is ambiguous.
  - Print any rides whose end is ambiguous.
```py
# Loop over trips
for trip in onebike_datetimes:
  # Rides with ambiguous start
  if tz.datetime_ambiguous(trip['start']):
    print("Ambiguous start at " + str(trip['start']))
  # Rides with ambiguous end
  if tz.datetime_ambiguous(trip['end']):
    print("Ambiguous end at " + str(trip['end']))

'''
Ambiguous start at 2017-11-05 01:56:50-04:00
Ambiguous end at 2017-11-05 01:01:04-04:00
'''
```
# Cleaning daylight saving data with fold
- Complete the if statement to be true only when a ride's start comes after its end.
- When start is after end, call tz.enfold() on the end so you know it refers to the one after the daylight savings time change.
- After the if statement, convert the start and end to UTC so you can make a proper comparison.
```py
trip_durations = []
for trip in onebike_datetimes:
  # When the start is later than the end, set the fold to be 1
  if trip['start'] > trip['end']:
    trip['end'] = tz.enfold(trip['end']) 
    '''so you know it refers to the one after the daylight savings time change.'''

  # Convert to UTC
  start = trip['start'].astimezone(timezone.utc)
  end = trip['end'].astimezone(timezone.utc)

  # Subtract the difference
  trip_length_seconds = (end-start).total_seconds()
  trip_durations.append(trip_length_seconds)

# Take the shortest trip duration
print("Shortest trip: " + str(min(trip_durations))) # Shortest trip: 116.0
```
