# ==> Dates in Python
## --> create date object
```py
from datetime import date
# create date
two_hurricanes_dates = [date(2016,10,7), date(2017,6,21)
```
## --> access components of dates through attributes
```py
print(two_hurricanes_dates[0].year)
print(two_hurricanes_dates[0].month)
print(two_hurricanes_dates[0].day)
# 2016
# 10
# 7
```
## --> weekday in date
```py
print(two_hurricanes_dates[0].weekday())
# 4 : date was a friday
```
- 0: monday....
- 5: saturday
- 6: sunday
# Which day of the week?
```py
# Import date from datetime
from datetime import date

# Create a date object
hurricane_andrew = date(1992, 8, 24)

# Which day of the week is the date?
print(hurricane_andrew.weekday())
# 0 : monday
```
# How many hurricanes come early?
- Complete the for loop to iterate through florida_hurricane_dates.
- Complete the if statement to increment the counter (early_hurricanes) if the hurricane made landfall before June.
```py
# Counter for how many before June 1
early_hurricanes = 0

# We loop over the dates
for hurricane in florida_hurricane_dates:
  # Check if the month is before June (month number 6)
  if hurricane.month < 6:
    early_hurricanes = early_hurricanes + 1
    
print(early_hurricanes)
# 10
```
