# ==> Dates in Python
## --> create date object
```py
from datetime import date
# create date
two_hurricanes_dates = [date(2016,10,7), date(2017,6,21)
```
## --> access components of dates through attributes
```py
print(two_hurricanes_dates[0].year)
print(two_hurricanes_dates[0].month)
print(two_hurricanes_dates[0].day)
# 2016
# 10
# 7
```
## --> weekday in date
```py
print(two_hurricanes_dates[0].weekday())
# 4 : date was a friday
```
- 0: monday....
- 5: saturday
- 6: sunday
# Which day of the week?
```py
# Import date from datetime
from datetime import date

# Create a date object
hurricane_andrew = date(1992, 8, 24)

# Which day of the week is the date?
print(hurricane_andrew.weekday())
# 0 : monday
```
# How many hurricanes come early?
- Complete the for loop to iterate through florida_hurricane_dates.
- Complete the if statement to increment the counter (early_hurricanes) if the hurricane made landfall before June.
```py
# Counter for how many before June 1
early_hurricanes = 0

# We loop over the dates
for hurricane in florida_hurricane_dates:
  # Check if the month is before June (month number 6)
  if hurricane.month < 6:
    early_hurricanes = early_hurricanes + 1
    
print(early_hurricanes)
# 10
```
# ==> Math with dates
### > timedelta
count days between dates
```py
d1= date(2017, 11,5)
d2= date(2017, 12, 4)
delta = d1 - d2
print(delta.days)
# 29
```
or we can do reverse timedelta
```py
# create a 29 day timedelta
td = timedelta(days=29)
print(d1 + td)
# 2017-12-04
```
# Subtracting dates
- Import date from datetime.
- Create a date object for May 9th, 2007, and assign it to the start variable.
- Create a date object for December 13th, 2007, and assign it to the end variable.
- Subtract start from end, to print the number of days in the resulting timedelta object.
```py
# Import date
from datetime import date

# Create a date object for May 9th, 2007
start = date(2007,5,9)

# Create a date object for December 13th, 2007
end = date(2007,12,13)

# Subtract the two dates and print the number of days timedelta
print((end - start).days)
# 218
```
# Counting events per calendar month
- Within the for loop:
- Assign month to be the month of that hurricane.
- Increment hurricanes_each_month for the relevant month by 1.
```py
# A dictionary to count hurricanes per calendar month
hurricanes_each_month = {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6:0,
		  				 7: 0, 8:0, 9:0, 10:0, 11:0, 12:0}

# Loop over all hurricanes
for hurricane in florida_hurricane_dates:
  # Pull out the month
  month = hurricane.month
  # Increment the count in your dictionary by one
  hurricanes_each_month[month] +=1
  
print(hurricanes_each_month)
```
# Putting a list of dates in order
```py
# Print the first and last scrambled dates
print(dates_scrambled[0])#  1988-08-04
print(dates_scrambled[-1])#  2011-07-18

# Put the dates in order
dates_ordered = sorted(dates_scrambled)

# Print the first and last ordered dates
print(dates_ordered[0])# 1950-08-31
print(dates_ordered[-1])# 2017-10-29
```
# ==> Turning dates into strings
iso format
```py
d = date (2017, 11, 5)
# ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD
print (d)
# 2017-11-05

# Express the date in IS0 860:
print([d.isoformat()])
# ['2017-11-05']
```
every other format : strftime()
```py
d = date(2017, 1, 5)
print(d.strftime("%Y"))
# 2017

# Format string with more text in it
print(d.strftime("Year is %Y"))
# Year is 2017

# format YYYY/MM/DD
print(d.strftime("%Y/%m/%d"))
# 2017/01/05
```
# Printing dates in a friendly format 
- Assign the earliest date in florida_hurricane_dates to first_date.
- Print first_date in the ISO standard. For example, December 1st, 2000 would be "2000-12-01".
- Print first_date in the US style, using .strftime(). For example, December 1st, 2000 would be "12/1/2000".
```py
# Assign the earliest date to first_date
first_date = min(florida_hurricane_dates)

# Convert to ISO and US formats
iso = "Our earliest hurricane date: " + first_date.isoformat()
us = "Our earliest hurricane date: " + first_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")

print("ISO: " + iso)
print("US: " + us)
# ISO: Our earliest hurricane date: 1950-08-31
# US: Our earliest hurricane date: 08/31/1950
```
# Representing dates in different ways
- Print andrew in the format 'YYYY-MM'.
```
# Import date
from datetime import date

# Create a date object
andrew = date(1992, 8, 26)

# Print the date in the format 'YYYY-MM'
print(andrew.strftime("%Y-%m")) # 1992-08
```
- Print andrew in the format 'MONTH (YYYY)', using %B for the month's full name, which in this case will be August.
- `%B` : month written
```py
# Import date
from datetime import date

# Create a date object
andrew = date(1992, 8, 26)

# Print the date in the format 'MONTH (YYYY)'
print(andrew.strftime("%B (%Y)")) # gives %m name andrew's: August (1992)
```
- Print andrew in the format 'YYYY-DDD' (where DDD is the day of the year) using %j.
- `%j` : day of year
```py
# Import date
from datetime import date

# Create a date object
andrew = date(1992, 8, 26)

# Print the date in the format 'YYYY-DDD'
print(andrew.strftime("%Y-%j"))# 1992-239
```
