# Non-negative data
Which of the following 2-dimensional arrays are examples of non-negative data?

- A tf-idf word-frequency array.
- An array daily stock market price movements (up and down), where each row represents a company.
- An array where rows are customers, columns are products and entries are 0 or 1, indicating whether a customer has purchased a product.

# NMF applied to Wikipedia articles
In the video, you saw NMF applied to transform a toy word-frequency array. Now it's your turn to apply NMF, this time using the tf-idf word-frequency array of Wikipedia articles, given as a csr matrix articles. Here, fit the model and transform the articles. In the next exercise, you'll explore the result.

Instructions

- Import NMF from sklearn.decomposition.
- Create an NMF instance called model with 6 components.
- Fit the model to the word count data articles.
- Use the .transform() method of model to transform articles, and assign the result to nmf_features.
- Print nmf_features to get a first idea what it looks like (.round(2) rounds the entries to 2 decimal places.)
```py
# Import NMF
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

# Create an NMF instance: model
model = NMF(n_components= 6)

# Fit the model to articles
model.fit(articles)

# Transform the articles: nmf_features
nmf_features = model.transform(articles)

# Print the NMF features
print(nmf_features.round(2))
```
# NMF features of the Wikipedia articles
Now you will explore the NMF features you created in the previous exercise. A solution to the previous exercise has been pre-loaded, so the array nmf_features is available. Also available is a list titles giving the title of each Wikipedia article.

When investigating the features, notice that for both actors, the NMF feature 3 has by far the highest value. This means that both articles are reconstructed using mainly the 3rd NMF component. In the next video, you'll see why: NMF components represent topics (for instance, acting!).

Instructions

- Import pandas as pd.
- Create a DataFrame df from nmf_features using pd.DataFrame(). Set the index to titles using index=titles.
- Use the .loc[] accessor of df to select the row with title 'Anne Hathaway', and print the result. These are the NMF features for the article about the actress Anne Hathaway.
- Repeat the last step for 'Denzel Washington' (another actor)
```py
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(nmf_features, index=titles)

# Print the row for 'Anne Hathaway'
print(df.loc['Anne Hathaway'])

# Print the row for 'Denzel Washington'
print(df.loc['Denzel Washington'])
```
