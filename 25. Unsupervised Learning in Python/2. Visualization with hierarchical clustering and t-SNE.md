# How many merges?
If there are 5 data samples, how many merge operations will occur in a hierarchical clustering? (To help answer this question, think back to the video, in which Ben walked through an example of hierarchical clustering using 6 countries.)
- [x] 4 merges.
# Hierarchical clustering of the grain data
In the video, you learned that the SciPy linkage() function performs hierarchical clustering on an array of samples. Use the linkage() function to obtain a hierarchical clustering of the grain samples, and use dendrogram() to visualize the result. A sample of the grain measurements is provided in the array samples, while the variety of each grain sample is given by the list varieties.

- Import:
  - linkage and dendrogram from scipy.cluster.hierarchy.
  - matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
- Perform hierarchical clustering on samples using the linkage() function with the method='complete' keyword argument. Assign the result to mergings.
- Plot a dendrogram using the dendrogram() function on mergings. Specify the keyword arguments labels=varieties, leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6.
```py
# Perform the necessary imports
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate the linkage: mergings
mergings = linkage(samples, method='complete')

# Plot the dendrogram, using varieties as labels
dendrogram(mergings,
           labels=varieties,
           leaf_rotation=90,
           leaf_font_size=6,
)
plt.show()
```

# Hierarchies of stocks
In chapter 1, you used k-means clustering to cluster companies according to their stock price movements. Now, you'll perform hierarchical clustering of the companies. You are given a NumPy array of price movements movements, where the rows correspond to companies, and a list of the company names companies. SciPy hierarchical clustering doesn't fit into a sklearn pipeline, so you'll need to use the normalize() function from sklearn.preprocessing instead of Normalizer.

linkage and dendrogram have already been imported from scipy.cluster.hierarchy, and PyPlot has been imported as plt.

- Import normalize from sklearn.preprocessing.
- Rescale the price movements for each stock by using the normalize() function on movements.
- Apply the linkage() function to normalized_movements, using 'complete' linkage, to calculate the hierarchical clustering. Assign the result to mergings.
- Plot a dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering, using the list companies of company names as the labels. In addition, specify the leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6 keyword arguments as you did in the previous exercise.
```py
# Import normalize
from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalize

# Normalize the movements: normalized_movements
normalized_movements = Normalize(movements)

# Calculate the linkage: mergings
mergings = linkage(normalized_movements, method="complete")

# Plot the dendrogram
plt.dendrogram(mergings, labels=companies, leaf_rotation=90, leaf_font_size=6)
plt.show()
```
