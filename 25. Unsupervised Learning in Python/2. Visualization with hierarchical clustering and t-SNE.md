# How many merges?
If there are 5 data samples, how many merge operations will occur in a hierarchical clustering? (To help answer this question, think back to the video, in which Ben walked through an example of hierarchical clustering using 6 countries.)
- [x] 4 merges.
# Hierarchical clustering of the grain data
In the video, you learned that the SciPy linkage() function performs hierarchical clustering on an array of samples. Use the linkage() function to obtain a hierarchical clustering of the grain samples, and use dendrogram() to visualize the result. A sample of the grain measurements is provided in the array samples, while the variety of each grain sample is given by the list varieties.

- Import:
  - linkage and dendrogram from scipy.cluster.hierarchy.
  - matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
- Perform hierarchical clustering on samples using the linkage() function with the method='complete' keyword argument. Assign the result to mergings.
- Plot a dendrogram using the dendrogram() function on mergings. Specify the keyword arguments labels=varieties, leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6.
```py
# Perform the necessary imports
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate the linkage: mergings
mergings = linkage(samples, method='complete')

# Plot the dendrogram, using varieties as labels
dendrogram(mergings,
           labels=varieties,
           leaf_rotation=90,
           leaf_font_size=6,
)
plt.show()
```

# Hierarchies of stocks
In chapter 1, you used k-means clustering to cluster companies according to their stock price movements. Now, you'll perform hierarchical clustering of the companies. You are given a NumPy array of price movements movements, where the rows correspond to companies, and a list of the company names companies. SciPy hierarchical clustering doesn't fit into a sklearn pipeline, so you'll need to use the normalize() function from sklearn.preprocessing instead of Normalizer.

linkage and dendrogram have already been imported from scipy.cluster.hierarchy, and PyPlot has been imported as plt.

Instructions
100 XP
- Import normalize from sklearn.preprocessing.
- Rescale the price movements for each stock by using the normalize() function on movements.
- Apply the linkage() function to normalized_movements, using 'complete' linkage, to calculate the hierarchical clustering. Assign the result to mergings.
- Plot a dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering, using the list companies of company names as the labels. In addition, specify the leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6 keyword arguments as you did in the previous exercise.
```py
# Import normalize
from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize

# Normalize the movements: normalized_movements
normalized_movements = normalize(movements)

# Calculate the linkage: mergings
mergings = linkage(normalized_movements, method="complete")

# Plot the dendrogram
dendrogram(mergings, labels=companies, leaf_rotation=90, leaf_font_size=6)
plt.show()
```

# Which clusters are closest?
In the video, you learned that the linkage method defines how the distance between clusters is measured. In complete linkage, the distance between clusters is the distance between the furthest points of the clusters. In single linkage, the distance between clusters is the distance between the closest points of the clusters.

Consider the three clusters in the diagram. Which of the following statements are true?

- [ ] A. In single linkage, Cluster 3 is the closest cluster to Cluster 2.
- [ ] B. In complete linkage, Cluster 1 is the closest cluster to Cluster 2.
- [x] C. Both A and B.
# Different linkage, different hierarchical clustering!
In the video, you saw a hierarchical clustering of the voting countries at the Eurovision song contest using 'complete' linkage. Now, perform a hierarchical clustering of the voting countries with 'single' linkage, and compare the resulting dendrogram with the one in the video. Different linkage, different hierarchical clustering!

You are given an array samples. Each row corresponds to a voting country, and each column corresponds to a performance that was voted for. The list country_names gives the name of each voting country. This dataset was obtained from Eurovision.

Instructions
100 XP
- Import linkage and dendrogram from scipy.cluster.hierarchy.
- Perform hierarchical clustering on samples using the linkage() function with the method='single' keyword argument. Assign the result to mergings.
- Plot a dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering, using the list country_names as the labels. In addition, specify the leaf_rotation=90, and leaf_font_size=6 keyword arguments as you have done earlier.
```py
# Perform the necessary imports
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram

# Calculate the linkage: mergings
mergings = linkage(samples, method="single")

# Plot the dendrogram
dendrogram(mergings, labels = country_names, leaf_rotation=90, leaf_font_size=6)
plt.show()
```

# Intermediate clusterings
Displayed on the right is the dendrogram for the hierarchical clustering of the grain samples that you computed earlier. If the hierarchical clustering were stopped at height 6 on the dendrogram, how many clusters would there be?

Possible Answers
- [ ] 1.
- [x] 3.
- [ ] As many as there were at the beginning.
# Extracting the cluster labels
In the previous exercise, you saw that the intermediate clustering of the grain samples at height 6 has 3 clusters. Now, use the fcluster() function to extract the cluster labels for this intermediate clustering, and compare the labels with the grain varieties using a cross-tabulation.

The hierarchical clustering has already been performed and mergings is the result of the linkage() function. The list varieties gives the variety of each grain sample.

- Import:
  - pandas as pd.
  - fcluster from scipy.cluster.hierarchy.
- Perform a flat hierarchical clustering by using the fcluster() function on mergings. Specify a maximum height of 6 and the keyword argument criterion='distance'.
- Create a DataFrame df with two columns named 'labels' and 'varieties', using labels and varieties, respectively, for the column values. This has been done for you.
- Create a cross-tabulation ct between df['labels'] and df['varieties'] to count the number of times each grain variety coincides with each cluster label.
```py
# Perform the necessary imports
import pandas as pd
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import fcluster

# Use fcluster to extract labels: labels
labels = fcluster(mergings, 6, criterion='distance')

# Create a DataFrame with labels and varieties as columns: df
df = pd.DataFrame({'labels': labels, 'varieties': varieties})

# Create crosstab: ct
ct = pd.crosstab(df['labels'], df['varieties'])

# Display ct
print(ct)
```

# t-SNE visualization of grain dataset
In the video, you saw t-SNE applied to the iris dataset. In this exercise, you'll apply t-SNE to the grain samples data and inspect the resulting t-SNE features using a scatter plot. You are given an array samples of grain samples and a list variety_numbers giving the variety number of each grain sample.

# A t-SNE map of the stock market
t-SNE provides great visualizations when the individual samples can be labeled. In this exercise, you'll apply t-SNE to the company stock price data. A scatter plot of the resulting t-SNE features, labeled by the company names, gives you a map of the stock market! The stock price movements for each company are available as the array normalized_movements (these have already been normalized for you). The list companies gives the name of each company. PyPlot (plt) has been imported for you.
