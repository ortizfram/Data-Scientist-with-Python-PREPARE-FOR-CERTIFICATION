If we don't clean we'll compromise insights and reports generated
### > see data types
      sales.dtypes
      # if it's 'object' means it's a String
### > see data info + missing values
      sales.info()
## --> string to int
```py
# summing this will give a large string instead of the total revenue cause it's an object (string)
sales['Revenue'].sum
# '2342234$8868271$9192839$'

# Remove the '$' from Revenue column
sales['Revenue'] = sales['Revenue'].str.strip('$') # remove '$'
sales['Revenue'] = sales['Revenue'].astype('int') # to int

# Assert method for checking dtype
assert sales['Revenue'].dtype == 'int' # if it's met returns nothing, error if it's not
```
