If we don't clean we'll compromise insights and reports generated
### > see data types
      sales.dtypes
      # if it's 'object' means it's a String
### > see data info + missing values
      sales.info()
### > see data column statistics summary
      sales['user_type'].describe()
## --> string to int
```py
# summing this will give a large string instead of the total revenue cause it's an object (string)
sales['Revenue'].sum
# '2342234$8868271$9192839$'

# Remove the '$' from Revenue column
sales['Revenue'] = sales['Revenue'].str.strip('$') # remove '$'
sales['Revenue'] = sales['Revenue'].astype('int') # to int

# Assert method for checking dtype
assert sales['Revenue'].dtype == 'int' # if it's met returns nothing, error if it's not
```
# Common data types
- Numeric data types

      Number of points on customer loyalty
      card
      Number of items bought in a basket
      Salary earned monthly
- Text

      City of residence
      Shipping address of a customer
      First name
- Dates

      Order date of a product
      Birthdates of clients
# Numeric data or ... ?
- Print the information of ride_sharing.
- Use .describe() to print the summary statistics of the user_type column from ride_sharing.
```py
# Print the information of ride_sharing
print(ride_sharing.info())

# Print summary statistics of user_type column
print(ride_sharing['user_type'].describe())
```
Question
> By looking at the summary statistics - they don't really seem to offer much description on how users are distributed along their purchase type, why do you think that is?
- Possible Answers
- [ ] The user_type column is not of the correct type, it should be converted to str.
- [ ] The user_type column has an infinite set of possible values, it should be converted to category.
- [x] The user_type column has an finite set of possible values that represent groupings of data, it should be converted to category
---
- Convert user_type into categorical by assigning it the 'category' data type and store it in the user_type_cat column.
- Make sure you converted user_type_cat correctly by using an assert statement.
```py
# Print the information of ride_sharing
print(ride_sharing.info())

# Print summary statistics of user_type column
print(ride_sharing['user_type'].describe())

# Convert user_type from integer to category
ride_sharing['user_type_cat'] = ride_sharing['user_type'].astype('category')

# Write an assert statement confirming the change
assert ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].dtype == 'category'

# Print new summary statistics 
print(ride_sharing['user_type_cat'].describe()) # described as category to see distribution
```
