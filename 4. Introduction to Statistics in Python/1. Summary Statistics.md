# 🍎 What is statistics?
- ❓ practice and study of collecting and analyzing data
### 📚 DO? > 
   - how likely is smo to purchase a product
   - more likely if they had different payment system?
   - occupants of a hotel, and how to optimize occupancy?
   - a mean jean size so they fit to a 90% of population
   - which ad is more effective in getting people to purchase a product
### 📚 types of statistics? >

# 🍎 Measures of center
👑 Numpy as np
- ❓mean : avg
- ❓median : center
- ❓mode : most frequent
## 🦍 Mean and median
```py
# Import numpy with alias np
import numpy as np

# Filter for Belgium
be_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'Belgium']

# Filter for USA
usa_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'USA']

# Calculate mean and median consumption in Belgium
print(np.mean(be_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(be_consumption['consumption']))

# Calculate mean and median consumption of USA
print(np.mean(usa_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(usa_consumption['consumption']))
```

      44.650000000000006
      14.58

'''country mean and median food consumption'''
# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Subset for Belgium and USA only
be_and_usa = food_consumption[(food_consumption['country']=='Belgium') | \
                              (food_consumption['country']=='USA')]

# Group by country, select consumption column, and compute mean and median
print(be_and_usa.groupby('country')['consumption'].agg([np.mean, np.median]))
```

      USA      44.650   14.58
## 🦍 Mean vs. median
- [x] 1. Import matplotlib.pyplot with the alias plt.
- [x] 1. Subset food_consumption to get the rows where food_category is 'rice'.
- [x] 1. Create a histogram of co2_emission for rice and show the plot.
```py
# Import matplotlib.pyplot with alias plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Subset for food_category equals rice
rice_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['food_category']=='rice']

# Histogram of co2_emission for rice and show plot
rice_consumption['co2_emission'].hist()
plt.show()
```

Question
> Take a look at the histogram you just created of different countries' CO2 emissions for rice. Which of the following terms best describes the shape of the data?

Possible Answers
- [ ] no skew
- [ ] Left-skewed
- [x] Right-skewed
```py
# Subset for food_category equals rice
rice_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['food_category'] == 'rice']

# Calculate mean and median of co2_emission with .agg()
print(rice_consumption['co2_emission'].agg([np.mean, np.median]))
```
      mean      37.592
      median    15.200
      Name:     co2_emission, dtype: float64
Question
> Given the skew of this data, what measure of central tendency best summarizes the kilograms of CO2 emissions per person per year for rice?

Possible Answers
- [ ] Mean
- [x] Median   # looking at the hist (center)
- [ ] Both mean and median
# 🍎 Measures of spread
### 📚 spread? >
❓ describes how spread apart or close data points are
### 📚 2 measures spread >
### 👽 variance

❓ avg distance from each point
#### 🏹 calculate variance
`1. substract mean from each data point`,`2. square each distance`,`3. sum sqr distances`,`4. divide by n of data point -1`

      dists= msleep['sleep_total'] - 
            np.mean(msleep['sleep_total'])
      print(dists)
      
      sq_dists = dists ** 2
      print(sq_dists)
      
      sum_sqr_dists = np.sum(dists)
      print(sum_sqr_dists)
      
      variance= sum_sqr_dists / (83 - 1)
      print(variance)
#### 🏹 calculate variance 1 👞
👑 same result as [calculate variance](#-calculate-variance) but one-liner

`using np-dot-var ,setting ddof arg to 1`

      np.var(msleep['sleep_total'], ddof=1)
### 👽 standard deviation
❓ calculated by taking square root of the variance 

      np.sqrt(np.var(msleep['total_sleep'], ddof=1))
`using np-dot-std ,setting ddof arg to 1`
      
      np.std(msleep['total_sleep'], ddof=1)
### 👽 mean absolute deviation
❓ takes absolut value of distances to the mean of those differences

👑 similar as std 

      dists = msleep['sleep_total'] - mean(msleep$sleep_total)
      np.mean(np.abs(dists))
### 👽 quantiles
- also called `percentiles`

❓ splits data into some n of equal parts
```py
''' 50% of mammals in dataset sleeps less than 10.1 hrs. exactly same as median'''
np.quantile(msleep['total_sleep'], 0.5)

# QUARTILES
'''split data into 4 equal parts'''
np.quantile(msleep['total_sleep'], [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1])
# array ([ 1.9, 7.85, 10.1, 13.75, 19.9])
```
#### 🏹 boxplots
👑 use quartiles

      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      plt.boxplot(msleep ['sleep_total'])
      plt.show()
     
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51888893/207355538-18783d35-c015-4f4e-aba2-f5d5da31d077.png" width=300px>

#### 🏹 Quantiles using np.linspace()
❓ easier than specifying every num [quantiles 1 👞](#-quantiles)

`np.linspace(start, stop, num)`
```py
np.quantile(msleep['total_sleep'], np.linspace(0,1,5))
# array ([ 1.9, 7.85, 10.1, 13.75, 19.9])
```
#### 🏹 interquatile range (IQR)
👑 distance between 25th and 75th percentile

❓ also height of the box in boxplot
```py
np.quantile(msleep['total_sleep'], 0.75 - np.quantile(msleep['total_sleep'], 0.25))
# 5.9
```
#### 🏹 👞 interquatile range (IQR) 
`using iqr funciton from scipy.stats`
```py
from scypy.stats import iqr
iqr(msleep['total_sleep'])
# 5.9
```
