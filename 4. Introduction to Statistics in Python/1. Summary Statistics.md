# 🍎 What is statistics?
- ❓ practice and study of collecting and analyzing data
### 📚 DO? > 
   - how likely is smo to purchase a product
   - more likely if they had different payment system?
   - occupants of a hotel, and how to optimize occupancy?
   - a mean jean size so they fit to a 90% of population
   - which ad is more effective in getting people to purchase a product
### 📚 types of statistics? >
- descriptive statistics :
  - ❓ describes, summarize data  
- inferential statistics :
  - ❓ use sample of data to make inferences ab. a larger population

## 🦍 Descriptive and inferential statistics
- **Descriptive**
   - [ ] Given data on every customer service request made, what's the average
time It took to respond?

people clicked on It?
- **Inferential**
   - [ ] After Interviewing 100 customers, what percent of all your customers a
satisfted with your product?
   - [ ] Glven data on 20 fish caught In a lake, what's the average welght of al
fish In the lake?

## 🦍 Data type classification
- **Continuous numeric**
   - [ ] Alr temperature
   - [ ] Kllowatts of electricity used
- **Discrete numeric**
   - [ ] Number of clicks on an ad
   - [ ] Number of Items In stock
   - [ ] Number of DataCamp courses taken
- **Categorical**
   - [ ] Zip code
   - [ ] Brand of a product
# 🍎 Measures of center
👑 Numpy as np
- ❓mean : avg
- ❓median : center
- ❓mode : most frequent
## 🦍 Mean and median
```py
# Import numpy with alias np
import numpy as np

# Filter for Belgium
be_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'Belgium']

# Filter for USA
usa_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'USA']

# Calculate mean and median consumption in Belgium
print(np.mean(be_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(be_consumption['consumption']))

# Calculate mean and median consumption of USA
print(np.mean(usa_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(usa_consumption['consumption']))
```

      12.59
      44.650000000000006
      14.58
```py
'''country mean and median food consumption'''
# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Subset for Belgium and USA only
be_and_usa = food_consumption[(food_consumption['country']=='Belgium') | \
                              (food_consumption['country']=='USA')]

# Group by country, select consumption column, and compute mean and median
print(be_and_usa.groupby('country')['consumption'].agg([np.mean, np.median]))
```
                  mean  median
      country                
      Belgium  42.133   12.59
      USA      44.650   14.58
## 🦍 Mean vs. median
- [x] 1. Import matplotlib.pyplot with the alias plt.
- [x] 1. Subset food_consumption to get the rows where food_category is 'rice'.
- [x] 1. Create a histogram of co2_emission for rice and show the plot.
```py
# Import matplotlib.pyplot with alias plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Subset for food_category equals rice
rice_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['food_category']=='rice']

# Histogram of co2_emission for rice and show plot
rice_consumption['co2_emission'].hist()
plt.show()
```

Question
> Take a look at the histogram you just created of different countries' CO2 emissions for rice. Which of the following terms best describes the shape of the data?

Possible Answers
- [ ] no skew
- [ ] Left-skewed
- [x] Right-skewed
```py
# Subset for food_category equals rice
rice_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['food_category'] == 'rice']

# Calculate mean and median of co2_emission with .agg()
print(rice_consumption['co2_emission'].agg([np.mean, np.median]))
```
      mean      37.592
      median    15.200
      Name:     co2_emission, dtype: float64
Question
> Given the skew of this data, what measure of central tendency best summarizes the kilograms of CO2 emissions per person per year for rice?

Possible Answers
- [ ] Mean
- [x] Median   # looking at the hist (center)
- [ ] Both mean and median
# 🍎 Measures of spread
### 📚 spread? >
❓ describes how spread apart or close data points are
### 📚 2 measures spread >
### 👽 variance

❓ avg distance from each point
#### 🏹 calculate variance
`1. substract mean from each data point`,`2. square each distance`,`3. sum sqr distances`,`4. divide by n of data point -1`

      dists= msleep['sleep_total'] - 
            np.mean(msleep['sleep_total'])
      print(dists)
      
      sq_dists = dists ** 2
      print(sq_dists)
      
      sum_sqr_dists = np.sum(dists)
      print(sum_sqr_dists)
      
      variance= sum_sqr_dists / (83 - 1)
      print(variance)
#### 🏹 calculate variance 1 👞
👑 same result as [calculate variance](#-calculate-variance) but one-liner

`using np-dot-var ,setting ddof arg to 1`

      np.var(msleep['sleep_total'], ddof=1)
### 👽 standard deviation
❓ calculated by taking square root of the variance 

      np.sqrt(np.var(msleep['total_sleep'], ddof=1))
`using np-dot-std ,setting ddof arg to 1`
      
      np.std(msleep['total_sleep'], ddof=1)
