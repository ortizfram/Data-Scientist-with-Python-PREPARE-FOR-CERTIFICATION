# 🍎 Measures of center
👑 Numpy as np
- ❓mean : avg
- ❓median : center
- ❓mode : most frequent
## 🦍 Mean and median

# Import numpy with alias np
import numpy as np

# Filter for Belgium

# Calculate mean and median consumption in Belgium
print(np.mean(be_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(be_consumption['consumption']))

# Calculate mean and median consumption of USA
print(np.mean(usa_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(usa_consumption['consumption']))
