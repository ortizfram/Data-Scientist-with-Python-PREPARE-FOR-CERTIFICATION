Question
> Which probability distribution do the sales amounts most closely follow?

Possible Answers
- [ ] Uniform
- [ ] Binomial
- [x] Normal
- [ ] None of the above
## 🦍 Probabilities from the normal distribution
close on less than $7500
```py
# Probability of deal < 7500
prob_less_7500 = norm.cdf(7500, 5000, 2000) # interest, mean, deviation

print(prob_less_7500)
```
    0.8943502263331446
close more than $1000
```py
# Probability of deal > 1000
prob_over_1000 = 1- norm.cdf(1000,5000,2000)# interest, mean, deviation 

print(prob_over_1000)
```
    0.9772498680518208
between $3000 and $7000
```py
# Probability of deal between 3000 and 7000
prob_3000_to_7000 = norm.cdf(7000,5000,2000) - norm.cdf(3000,5000,2000)

print(prob_3000_to_7000)
```
    0.6826894921370859
what amount is less than 25% of sales
```py
# Calculate amount that 25% of deals will be less than
pct_25 = norm.ppf(0.25, 5000, 2000)

print(pct_25)
```
        3651
## 🦍 Simulating sales under new market conditions
```py
# Calculate new average amount
new_mean = 5000 * 1.2

# Calculate new standard deviation
new_sd = 2000 * 1.3

# Simulate 36 new sales
new_sales = norm.rvs(new_mean, new_sd, 36)

# Create histogram and show
plt.hist(new_sales)
plt.show()
```

## 🦍 Which market is better?
Recall that Amir's current sales amounts have a mean of $5000 and a standard deviation of $2000, and Amir's predicted amounts in next quarter's market have a mean of $6000 and a standard deviation of $2600.

> Based only on the metric of percent of sales over $1000, does Amir perform better in the current market or the predicted market?

Possible Answers
- [ ] Amir performs much better in the current market.
- [ ] Amir performs much better in next quarter's predicted market.
- [x] Amir performs about equally in both markets.

## 🦍 The t-distribution
> Which statement is ***not true*** regarding the t-distribution?

Possible Answers
- [ ] The t-distribution has thicker tails than the normal distribution.
- [ ] A t-distribution with high degrees of freedom resembles the normal distribution.
- [ ] The number of degrees of freedom affects the distribution's variance.
- [x] The t-distribution is skewed.
👀  t-distribution is not skewed, just like the normal distribution, but it does have thicker tails and higher variance than the normal distribution.
