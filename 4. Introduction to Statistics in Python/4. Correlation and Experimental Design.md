## 🦍 Guess the correlation
> Which of the following statements is ***NOT true*** about correlation?
- [ ] If the correlation between x and y has a `high magnitude`, the data points will be clustered closely around a line.
- [ ] Correlation can be `written as 'r'`
- [ ] If x and y are `negatively correlated`, values of 'y' decrease as values of 'x' increase
- [x] Correlation cannot be 0.
