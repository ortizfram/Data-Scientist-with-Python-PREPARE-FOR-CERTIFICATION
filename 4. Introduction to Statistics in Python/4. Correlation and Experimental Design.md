## 🦍 Guess the correlation
> Which of the following statements is ***NOT true*** about correlation?
- [ ] If the correlation between x and y has a `high magnitude`, the data points will be clustered closely around a line.
- [ ] Correlation can be `written as 'r'`
- [ ] If x and y are `negatively correlated`, values of 'y' decrease as values of 'x' increase
- [x] Correlation cannot be 0.
## 🦍 Relationships between variables
```py
# Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp and show
sns.scatterplot(y= 'happiness_score', x= 'life_exp', data= world_happiness)

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

trendline
```py
# Create scatterplot of happiness_score vs life_exp with trendline
sns.lmplot(y= 'happiness_score', x= 'life_exp', data= world_happiness, ci=None)

# Show plot
plt.show()
```

Question
> Based on the scatterplot, which is most likely the correlation between life_exp and happiness_score?
- [ ] 0.3
- [ ] -0.3
- [x] 0.8
- [ ] -0.8

calculate correlation
```py
# Correlation between life_exp and happiness_score
cor = world_happiness['life_exp'].corr(world_happiness['happiness_score'])

print(cor)
```
