## 游붌 Guess the correlation
> Which of the following statements is ***NOT true*** about correlation?
- [ ] If the correlation between x and y has a `high magnitude`, the data points will be clustered closely around a line.
- [ ] Correlation can be `written as 'r'`
- [ ] If x and y are `negatively correlated`, values of 'y' decrease as values of 'x' increase
- [x] Correlation cannot be 0.

Question
> The correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy is 0.7. Why is correlation ***not*** the best way to measure the relationship between these two variables?
- [ ] Correlation measures how one variable affects another.
- [x] Correlation only measures linear relationships.
- [ ] Correlation cannot properly measure relationships between numeric variables.

Question
> Based on this data, which statement about sugar consumption and happiness scores is true?
- [ ] Increased sugar consumption leads to a higher happiness score.
- [ ] Lower sugar consumption results in a lower happiness score
- [x] Increased sugar consumption is associated with a higher happiness score.
- [ ] Sugar consumption is not related to happiness.
## 游붌 confounders
> Which of the following could be a confounder in this study?
- [ ] Lung capacity
- [ ] Neighborhood
- [x] Air pollution
- [ ] Smoking status
- [ ] Gender
游녬 You would expect there to be more air pollution in the neighborhood situated near the highway, which can cause lower lung capacity.
# 游꼝 Design of experiments
## 游붌 Study types
- Controlled experiment
- [ ] Subjects are randomly assigned to a diet and weight loss is
compared.
- [ ] Purchasing rates are compared between users of an e-commerce site
who are randomly directed to a new version of the home page or an
old version.
- [ ] Asthma symptoms are compared between children randomly
assigned to receive professional home pest management services or
pest management education.
- Observational study
- [ ] Prevalence of heart disease is compared between veterans with PTS
and veterans without PTSD.
- [ ] A week ago, the home page of an e-commerce site was updated.
- [ ] Purchasing rates are compared between users who saw the old and
new home page versions.
## 游붌 Longitudinal vs. cross-sectional studies
> A company manufactures thermometers, and they want to study the relationship between a thermometer's age and its accuracy. To do this, they take a sample of 100 different thermometers of different ages and test how accurate they are. Is this data longitudinal or cross-sectional?
- [ ] Longitudinal
- [x] Cross-sectional
- [ ] Both
- [ ] Neither
游녬 since researchers aren't following the same set of thermometers over time and repeatedly measuring their accuracy at different ages.
