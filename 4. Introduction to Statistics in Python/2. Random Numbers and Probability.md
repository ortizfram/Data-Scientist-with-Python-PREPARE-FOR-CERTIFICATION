- `With replacement`

❓ ***independent*** if the probability of the second event isn't afected by the outcome of the first event.
- [ ] Flipping a coin 3 times
- [ ] Rolling a die twice
- `Without replacement` 👑 ***can't choose same person twise***

❓ ***dependent*** if the probability of the second event is afected by the outcome of the first event.
- [ ] Randomly plcking 3 people to work on the weekend from a group of 20
people
- [ ] Randomly selecting 5 products from the assembly line to test for qualt
assurance
- [ ] From a deck of cards, dealing 3 players 7 cards each
## 🦍 Calculating probabilities
- [x] 1. Count the number of deals Amir worked on for each product type and store in counts.
```py
# Count the deals for each product. each type
counts = amir_deals['product'].value_counts()
print(counts)
```
    Product B    62
    Product D    40
    Product A    23
    Product C    15
    Product F    11
    Product H     8
    Product I     7
    Product E     5
    Product N     3
    Product G     2
    Product J     2
- [x] 2. Calculate the probability of selecting a deal for the different product types by dividing the counts by the total number of deals Amir worked on. Save this as probs.
```py
# Calculate probability of picking a deal with each product
'''types of prod / total prods = probability of picking'''
probs = counts / len(amir_deals['product'])
print(probs)
```
    Product B    0.348
    Product D    0.225
    Product A    0.129
    Product C    0.084
    Product F    0.062
    Product H    0.045
    Product I    0.039
    Product E    0.028
    Product N    0.017
    Product G    0.011
    Product J    0.011

## 🦍 Sampling deals
:neckbeard:  pick five deals so that you can reach out to each customer and ask if they were satisfied with the service they received. You'll try doing this both with and without replacement.
- [x] 1. Set the random seed to 24.
- [x] 1. Take a sample of 5 deals without replacement and store them as sample_without_replacement.
```py
# Set random seed
np.random.seed(24)  #always same choises

# Sample 5 deals without replacement
sample_without_replacement = amir_deals.sample(5, replace=False)
print(sample_without_replacement)
```
             Unnamed: 0    product   client status   amount  num_users
        127         128  Product B  Current    Won  2070.25          7
        148         149  Product D  Current    Won  3485.48         52
        77           78  Product B  Current    Won  6252.30         27
        104         105  Product D  Current    Won  4110.98         39
        166         167  Product C      New   Lost  3779.86         11
- [x] 2. Take a sample of 5 deals with replacement and save as sample_with_replacement.
```py
# Set random seed
np.random.seed(24)

# Sample 5 deals with replacement
sample_with_replacement = amir_deals.sample(5, replace=True) # can be same person twice
print(sample_with_replacement)
```
             Unnamed: 0    product   client status   amount  num_users
        162         163  Product D  Current    Won  6755.66         59

## 🦍 Creating a probability distribution
- [x] 1. Create a histogram of the group_size column of restaurant_groups, setting bins to [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Remember to show the plot.
```py
# Create a histogram of restaurant_groups and show plot
restaurant_groups['group_size'].hist(bins=[2,3,4,5,6])
plt.show()
```

- [x] 2. Count the number of each group_size in restaurant_groups, then divide by the number of rows in restaurant_groups to calculate the probability of randomly selecting a group of each size. Save as size_dist.
- [x] 2. Reset the index of size_dist.
- [x] 2. Rename the columns of size_dist to group_size and prob.
```py
