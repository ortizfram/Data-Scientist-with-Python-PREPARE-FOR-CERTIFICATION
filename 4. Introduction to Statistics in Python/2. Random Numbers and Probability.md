## 🦍 With or without replacement?
- `With replacement`

❓ ***independent*** if the probability of the second event isn't afected by the outcome of the first event.
- [ ] Flipping a coin 3 times
- [ ] Rolling a die twice
- `Without replacement`

❓ ***dependent*** if the probability of the second event is afected by the outcome of the first event.
- [ ] Randomly plcking 3 people to work on the weekend from a group of 20
people
- [ ] Randomly selecting 5 products from the assembly line to test for qualt
assurance
- [ ] From a deck of cards, dealing 3 players 7 cards each
## 🦍 Calculating probabilities
- [x] 1. Count the number of deals Amir worked on for each product type and store in counts.
```py
# Count the deals for each product. each type
counts = amir_deals['product'].value_counts()
print(counts)
```
    Product B    62
    Product D    40
    Product A    23
    Product C    15
    Product F    11
    Product H     8
    Product I     7
    Product E     5
    Product N     3
    Product G     2
    Product J     2
- [x] 2. Calculate the probability of selecting a deal for the different product types by dividing the counts by the total number of deals Amir worked on. Save this as probs.
```py
# Calculate probability of picking a deal with each product
'''types of prod / total prods = probability of picking'''
probs = counts / len(amir_deals['product'])
print(probs)
```
    Product B    0.348
    Product D    0.225
    Product A    0.129
    Product C    0.084
    Product F    0.062
    Product H    0.045
    Product I    0.039
    Product E    0.028
    Product N    0.017
    Product G    0.011
    Product J    0.011
Question
> If you randomly select one of Amir's deals, what's the probability that the deal will involve Product C?

Possible Answers

## 🦍 Sampling deals
- [x] 1. Set the random seed to 24.
- [x] 1. Take a sample of 5 deals without replacement and store them as sample_without_replacement.
