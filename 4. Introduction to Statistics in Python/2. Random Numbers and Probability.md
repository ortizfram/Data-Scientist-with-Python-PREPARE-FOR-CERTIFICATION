## 🦍 Calculating probabilities
- [x] 1. Count the number of deals Amir worked on for each product type and store in counts.
```py
# Count the deals for each product. each type
counts = amir_deals['product'].value_counts()
print(counts)
```

## 🦍 Sampling deals
:neckbeard:  pick five deals so that you can reach out to each customer and ask if they were satisfied with the service they received. You'll try doing this both with and without replacement.
- [x] 1. Set the random seed to 24.
- [x] 1. Take a sample of 5 deals without replacement and store them as sample_without_replacement.
```py
# Set random seed

# Sample 5 deals without replacement
sample_without_replacement = amir_deals.sample(5, replace=False)
print(sample_without_replacement)

- [x] 2. Take a sample of 5 deals with replacement and save as sample_with_replacement.
```py
# Set random seed
np.random.seed(24)

# Sample 5 deals with replacement
sample_with_replacement = amir_deals.sample(5, replace=True) # can be same person twice

## 🦍 Creating a probability distribution
- [x] 1. Create a histogram of the group_size column of restaurant_groups, setting bins to [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Remember to show the plot.
```py
# Create a histogram of restaurant_groups and show plot
restaurant_groups['group_size'].hist(bins=[2,3,4,5,6])
plt.show()
```

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51888893/207448780-4561a8df-8105-47b1-9b30-6a4d2209abda.png" width=300px>

- [x] 2. Count the number of each group_size in restaurant_groups, then divide by the number of rows in restaurant_groups to calculate the probability of randomly selecting a group of each size. Save as size_dist.
- [x] 2. Reset the index of size_dist.
- [x] 2. Rename the columns of size_dist to group_size and prob.
```py
# Create probability distribution
size_dist = restaurant_groups['group_size'] / len(restaurant_groups['group_size'])

# Reset index and rename columns
size_dist = size_dist.reset_index()
size_dist.columns = ['group_size', 'prob']

print(size_dist)
```
           group_size  prob
        0           0   0.2
        1           1   0.4
        2           2   0.6 #---> more prob
        3           3   0.2
        4           4   0.2
        5           5   0.2
        6           6   0.3
        7           7   0.2
        8           8   0.4
        9           9   0.2
- [x] 3. Calculate the expected value of the size_distribution, which represents the expected group size, by multiplying the group_size by the prob and taking the sum.
```py
# Expected value
expected_value = np.sum(size_dist['group_size'] * size_dist['prob'])
print(expected_value)
```
- [x] 4. Calculate the probability of randomly picking a group of 4 or more people by subsetting for groups of size 4 or more and summing the probabilities of selecting those groups.
```py
# Subset groups of size 4 or more
groups_4_or_more = size_dist[size_dist['group_size'] >= 4]

# Sum the probabilities of groups_4_or_more
prob_4_or_more = np.sum(groups_4_or_more['prob'])
print(prob_4_or_more)
```
