## ü¶ç One-to-many merge with multiple tables
- [x] Merge land_use and census on the ward column. Merge the result of this with licenses on the ward column, using the suffix _cen for the left table and _lic for the right table. Save this to the variable land_cen_lic.
```py
# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use\
               .merge(census, on='ward')\
               .merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=['_cen','_lic'])
```
- [x] Group land_cen_lic by ward, pop_2010 (the population in 2010), and vacant, then count the number of accounts. Save the results to pop_vac_lic.
```py
# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use\
               .merge(census, on='ward') \
               .merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=('_cen','_lic'))

# Group by ward, pop_2010, and vacant, then count the # of accounts
pop_vac_lic = land_cen_lic\
              .groupby(["ward","pop_2010","vacant"], as_index=False)\
              .agg({'account':'count'})
```
- [x] Sort pop_vac_lic by vacant, account, andpop_2010 in descending, ascending, and ascending order respectively. Save it as sorted_pop_vac_lic.
```py
# Merge land_use and census and merge result with licenses including suffixes
land_cen_lic = land_use\
               .merge(census, on='ward')\
               .merge(licenses, on='ward', suffixes=('_cen','_lic'))

# Group by ward, pop_2010, and vacant, then count the # of accounts
pop_vac_lic = land_cen_lic\
              .groupby(['ward','pop_2010','vacant'], 
              as_index=False)\
              .agg({'account':'count'})

# Sort pop_vac_lic and print the results
sorted_pop_vac_lic = pop_vac_lic\
                    .sort_values(['vacant','account','pop_2010'],

# Print the top few rows of sorted_pop_vac_lic
