## ü¶ç Counting missing rows with left join
> What column is likely the best column to merge the two tables on?

Possible Answers

- [ ] on='budget'
- [ ] on='popularity'
- [x] on='id'

- [x] Merge the movies table, as the left table, with the financials table using a left join, and save the result to movies_financials.
```py
# Merge movies and financials with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')
```
- [x] Count the number of rows in movies_financials with a null value in the budget column.
```py
# Merge the movies table with the financials table with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Count the number of rows in the budget column that are missing
number_of_missing_fin = movies_financials['budget'].isnull().sum()

# Print the number of movies missing financials
print(number_of_missing_fin)
```
## ü¶ç Enriching a dataset
- [x] 1. Merge toy_story and taglines on the id column with a left join, and save the result as toystory_tag.
- [x] 2. With toy_story as the left table, merge to it taglines on the id column with an inner join, and save as toystory_tag.
```py
# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a left join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id', how='left')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)
```
```py
# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a inner join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)
```
## ü¶ç How many rows with a left join?


> Try running the following code statements in the IPython shell.
> Select the true statement about left joins.

    left_table.merge(one_to_one, on='id', how='left').shape
    left_table.merge(one_to_many, on='id', how='left').shape
--Note that the left_table starts out with 4 rows.

Possible Answers

- [ ] The output of a one-to-one merge with a left join will have more rows than the left table.
- [ ] The output of a one-to-one merge with a left join will have fewer rows than the left table.
- [x] The output of a one-to-many merge with a left join will have greater than or equal rows than the left table.
```py
left_table.merge(one_to_one, on='id', how='left').shape

left_table.merge(one_to_many, on='id', how='left').shape
```

## üìö outer join
‚ùì returns all whether match or not 
## üìö right join
‚ùì main is right and adds matching values from left
## ü¶ç Right join to find unique movies
- [x] 1. Merge action_movies and scifi_movies tables with a right join on movie_id. Save the result as action_scifi.
- [x] 2. Update the merge to add suffixes, where '_act' and '_sci' are suffixes for the left and right tables, respectively.
- [x] 3. From action_scifi, subset only the rows where the genre_act column is null.
- [x] 4. Merge movies and scifi_only using the id column in the left table and the movie_id column in the right table with an inner join.
```py
# Merge action_movies to scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right')
```
```py
# Merge action_movies to scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes=['_act','_sci'])

# Print the first few rows of action_scifi to see the structure
print(action_scifi.head())
```
```py
# Merge action_movies to the scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes=('_act','_sci'))

# From action_scifi, select only the rows where the genre_act column is null
scifi_only = action_scifi[action_scifi['genre_act'].isnull()]
```
```py
# Merge action_movies to the scifi_movies with right join
action_scifi = action_movies.merge(scifi_movies, on='movie_id', how='right',
                                   suffixes=('_act','_sci'))

# From action_scifi, select only the rows where the genre_act column is null
scifi_only = action_scifi[action_scifi['genre_act'].isnull()]

# Merge the movies and scifi_only tables with an inner join
movies_and_scifi_only = movies.merge(scifi_only, left_on='id', right_on='movie_id')

# Print the first few rows and shape of movies_and_scifi_only
print(movies_and_scifi_only.head())
print(movies_and_scifi_only.shape)
```
## Popular genres with right join
```py
# Use right join to merge the movie_to_genres and pop_movies tables
genres_movies = movie_to_genres.merge(pop_movies, how='right', 
                                      left_on='movie_id', 
                                      right_on='id')

# Count the number of genres
genre_count = genres_movies.groupby('genre').agg({'id':'count'})

# Plot a bar chart of the genre_count
genre_count.plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()
```
