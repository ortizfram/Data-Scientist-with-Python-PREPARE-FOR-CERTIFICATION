> What column is likely the best column to merge the two tables on?

Possible Answers

- [ ] on='budget'
- [ ] on='popularity'
- [x] on='id'

- [x] Merge the movies table, as the left table, with the financials table using a left join, and save the result to movies_financials.
```py
# Merge movies and financials with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')
```
- [x] Count the number of rows in movies_financials with a null value in the budget column.
```py
# Merge the movies table with the financials table with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Count the number of rows in the budget column that are missing
number_of_missing_fin = movies_financials['budget'].isnull().sum()

# Print the number of movies missing financials
print(number_of_missing_fin)
```

- [x] 1. Merge toy_story and taglines on the id column with a left join, and save the result as toystory_tag.
- [x] 2. With toy_story as the left table, merge to it taglines on the id column with an inner join, and save as toystory_tag.
```py
# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a left join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id', how='left')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)
```
```py
# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a inner join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)
```
