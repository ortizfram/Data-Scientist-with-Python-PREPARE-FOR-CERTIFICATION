## ü¶ç Counting missing rows with left join
> What column is likely the best column to merge the two tables on?

Possible Answers

- [ ] on='budget'
- [ ] on='popularity'
- [x] on='id'

- [x] Merge the movies table, as the left table, with the financials table using a left join, and save the result to movies_financials.
```py
# Merge movies and financials with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')
```
- [x] Count the number of rows in movies_financials with a null value in the budget column.
```py
# Merge the movies table with the financials table with a left join
movies_financials = movies.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Count the number of rows in the budget column that are missing
number_of_missing_fin = movies_financials['budget'].isnull().sum()

# Print the number of movies missing financials
print(number_of_missing_fin)
```
## ü¶ç Enriching a dataset
- [x] 1. Merge toy_story and taglines on the id column with a left join, and save the result as toystory_tag.
- [x] 2. With toy_story as the left table, merge to it taglines on the id column with an inner join, and save as toystory_tag.
```py
# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a left join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id', how='left')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)
```
```py
# Merge the toy_story and taglines tables with a inner join
toystory_tag = toy_story.merge(taglines, on='id')

# Print the rows and shape of toystory_tag
print(toystory_tag)
print(toystory_tag.shape)
```
## ü¶ç How many rows with a left join?


> Try running the following code statements in the IPython shell.
> Select the true statement about left joins.

    left_table.merge(one_to_one, on='id', how='left').shape
    left_table.merge(one_to_many, on='id', how='left').shape
--Note that the left_table starts out with 4 rows.

Possible Answers

- [ ] The output of a one-to-one merge with a left join will have more rows than the left table.
- [ ] The output of a one-to-one merge with a left join will have fewer rows than the left table.
- [x] The output of a one-to-many merge with a left join will have greater than or equal rows than the left table.
```py
left_table.merge(one_to_one, on='id', how='left').shape

left_table.merge(one_to_many, on='id', how='left').shape
```

## ü¶ç Self join
- [x] 1. To a variable called crews_self_merged, merge the crews table to itself on the id column using an inner join, setting the suffixes to '_dir' and '_crew' for the left and right tables respectively.
```py
# Merge the crews table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id',suffixes=['_dir','_crew'])
```
- [x] 2. Create a Boolean index, named boolean_filter, that selects rows from the left table with the job of 'Director' and avoids rows with the job of 'Director' in the right table.
```py
# Merge the crews table to itself
crews_self_merged = crews.merge(crews, on='id', how='inner',
                                suffixes=('_dir','_crew'))

# Create a Boolean index to select the appropriate
boolean_filter = ((crews_self_merged['job_dir'] == "Director") & 
     (crews_self_merged['job_crew'] != "Director"))
direct_crews = crews_self_merged[boolean_filter]
```
- [x] 3. Use the .head() method to print the first few rows of direct_crews.
```py

## ü¶ç How does pandas handle self joins?
> Select the false statement about merging a table to itself.

Possible Answers

- [ ] You can merge a table to itself with a right join.
- [ ] Merging a table to itself can allow you to compare values in a column to other values in the same column.
- [x] The pandas module limits you to one merge where you merge a table to itself. You cannot repeat this process over and over.
- [ ] Merging a table to itself is like working with two separate tables.

## ü¶ç Index merge for movie ratings
- [x] Merge movies and ratings on the index and save to a variable called movies_ratings, ensuring that all of the rows from the movies table are returned.

## ü¶ç Do sequels earn more?
- [x] 1. With the sequels table on the left, merge to it the financials table on index named id, ensuring that all the rows from the sequels are returned and some rows from the other table may not be returned, Save the results to sequels_fin.
```py
# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')
```
- [x] 2. Merge the sequels_fin table to itself with an inner join, where the left and right tables merge on sequel and id respectively with suffixes equal to ('_org','_seq'), saving to orig_seq.
```py
# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on sequel and right on id
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how="inner", left_on='sequel', 
                             right_on='id', right_index=True, #to use right index only 
                             suffixes=['_org','_seq'])

# Add calculation to subtract revenue_org from revenue_seq 
orig_seq['diff'] = orig_seq['revenue_seq'] - orig_seq['revenue_org']
```
- [x] 3. Select the title_org, title_seq, and diff columns of orig_seq and save this as titles_diff.
```py
# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on sequel and right on id
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how='inner', left_on='sequel',

# Select the title_org, title_seq, and diff 
titles_diff = orig_seq[['title_org', 'title_seq', 'diff']]

# Print the first rows of the sorted titles_diff
print(titles_diff.sort_values('diff',ascending=False).head())
```
- [x] 4. Sort by titles_diff by diff in descending order and print the first few rows.
```py
# Merge sequels and financials on index id
sequels_fin = sequels.merge(financials, on='id', how='left')

# Self merge with suffixes as inner join with left on sequel and right on id
orig_seq = sequels_fin.merge(sequels_fin, how='inner', left_on='sequel', 
                             right_on='id', right_index=True,
                             suffixes=('_org','_seq'))

# Add calculation to subtract revenue_org from revenue_seq 
orig_seq['diff'] = orig_seq['revenue_seq'] - orig_seq['revenue_org']
