# ==> Probability mass functions
- `pmf`
```py
pmf_educ = Pmf(educ, normalize=False)

# look value in pmf a get a count
pmf_educ[12] # Normalize False
# Return fraction of people w/  x value
pmf_educ[12] # Normalize True
```
# Make a PMF
- Make a PMF for year with normalize=False and display the result.
```py
# 1/. Compute the PMF for year
pmf_year = Pmf(gss['year'], normalize=False)

# Print the result
print(pmf_year)
```
- Question
```py
pmf_year = Pmf(gss['year'], normalize=False)
print(pmf_year[2016])
```
> How many respondents were interviewed in 2016?
- [x] 2867
- [ ] 1613
- [ ] 2538
- [ ] 0.045897
# Plot a PMF
- 1/. Select the 'age' column from the gss DataFrame and store the result in age.
```py
# Select the age column
age = gss['age']
```
- 2/. Make a normalized PMF of age. Store the result in pmf_age.
```py
# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

# Make a PMF of age
pmf_age = Pmf(age, normalize=True)
```
- 3/. Plot pmf_age as a bar chart.
```py
# Plot the PMF
pmf_age.bar()

# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('PMF')
plt.show()
```

# ==> Cumulative distribution functions
- `cdf` : cumulative probabilities from 0 to 1
```py
cdf Cdf (gss[ 'age ')
cdf.plot0
plt.xlabel ( 'Age')
plt.ylabel ( ' CDF')
plt.show()
```

- `inverse cdf`
```py
p = 0.25 # 25th percentile of age is 30
q = cdf.inverse(p)
print(q)
# 30
```

- `iqr` (interquartile range): difference between 25th and 75th percentetile
# Make a CDF
- 1/. Select the 'age' column. Store the result in age.
- 2/. Compute the CDF of age. Store the result in cdf_age.
- 3/. Calculate the CDF of 30.
```py
# Select the age column
age = gss['age']

# Compute the CDF of age
cdf_age = Cdf(age)

# Calculate the CDF of 30
print(cdf_age[30])
```
- Question
> What fraction of the respondents in the GSS dataset are OLDER than 30?
- ANSW= 75%
