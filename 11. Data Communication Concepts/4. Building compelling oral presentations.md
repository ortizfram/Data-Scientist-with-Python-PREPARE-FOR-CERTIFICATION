# A color building
You have planned the presentation for your findings on software development sector salaries for San Francisco employees. Now, it's time to build the slides. After putting your slide deck together, you ask your coworker to give you feedback. She makes comments on the different slides.

You start by reviewing the following graph slide.

One of the comments she wrote about the slide ***is not correct*** . Can you select which one it is?
- [x] The headline looks stylish. Even though the spacing between the letters is small, the font adds originality to the slide.
- [ ] The amount of graphs displayed is adequate. The two full-size graphs can be properly seen and compared.
- [ ] It's a good idea using the red square to emphasize one of the graph. It will make the audience focus on what graph you are explaining.

***font you choose should be easy to read.***
# Too much text
Your coworker also gives you feedback on slides that only have text. She feels like the slide can be improved a lot. She gives you some options on how you can improve the slide.

One of the following statement is ***not correct***. Can you select which one is it?

- [ ] Instead of writing all the text in paragraphs, convert each concise main idea to bullet points.
- [ ] The headline is well formated using big letters. Also, it is specific and concise.
- [x] Highlight the keywords in the text using red, green, yellow, blue, and magenta. Using several colors will help catch the audience's attention.
- [ ] It would be a good idea to break the slide into two slides. In the first one, put the second paragraph in gray. Reveal the text in the second slide.

***avoid using more than three colors in a slide as it can result in distraction.***
# The right building
Well done building a text slide! Now, you need to review the rest of the comments from your coworker. She left you the feedback in two stacks of notes: one stack for best practices and one stack for what you should avoid. However, the stacks fell during your lunch break and are all mixed up.
