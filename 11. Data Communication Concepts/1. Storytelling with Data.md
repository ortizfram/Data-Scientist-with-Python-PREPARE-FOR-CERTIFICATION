# üìò why needed?
(best results have ***no impact w/o good presentation/insight***)
- `convince` change-adverse stakeholders, specially if they are non-technical
# üìò What's data storytelling?
> practice of building narratives arond set of data accompanied by visualizations, to convey it's powerful and has a strong meaning 
- `Anecdotes` : drives imagination
- `Stories` : makes memorable
- `Add value` provides context
- `Attention` from the audiences is captured
- Facilitate `decision`-making

# üìö build effective story
## :atom: data
- ***only include*** `Findings` : from models or analysis
- `Relevant` : applied to a situation
- `Accurate` and reliable data
- `Actionable` insights : data that drives to actions
## üìù Narrative
- `compelling` and `easy` to undertand
- Prioritize `essential` points
- Drive `change`
-`main point
  - `Avoid disconnected` facts
  - `Central` insight
- Explanatory context
  - Undertand `background` and audience
  - `Clarify` facts to the audience
- Linear sequence : data-point build on each other until conclusion is reached
## üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è visuals
- Graphs should be
  - `simple`
  - `engaging`
  - `not misleading`
# The story begins
> You recently started working as a data sclentist at a company named Communicatb. For your first project
you and your team need to analyze churn customer data for a cell phone company. The goal Is to predict
thelr behavior and help develop a program to retaln customers.
Your team lead knows you are an expert on storytelling. She asks you to explain to the team why craftinga
compelling story Is Important when delvering results. You write down a lIst of reasons to be prepared.
One of the statements you wrote Is false. Can you select which one Is it?

(One of the statements you wrote is false. Can you select which one is it?)
- [ ] It will be easler for the audlence to remember an anecdote on why customers churn than the
correlation coeficlents between customer tralts.
- [ ] Your findings will be better allgned with change-adverse stakeholder expectations. They will be
most likely to Implement the program to retaln customers.
- [x] Even f your data do not reveal a distinct customer behavior, storytelling might Infuence
stakeholders to create the retention program.
- [ ] The marketing team wll have a better understanding of the Impact of your model. It ls central
since they are creating the retention program.

***Data is the foundation of your story. So you need to make sure you are telling a story based on reliable and accurate results!***
# Building a story
- Correctly classify the statements as either true or false.

- True
  - To drive change, center your story around how the company's profts will
   Increase If the retention program Is Implemented.
  - Present one supporting customer data point after each other so they
naturally reach a concluslon.
  - To create a compelling narrative, connect the most Important findings to
actlons of the retentlon program.
- False
  - To be clear and conclse, bulld one story and present It to the manager
and your technical team.
  - For adding value, Include all customers tralts analyzed to understand
why customers churn.
  - To drlve change, Include data froma successtul retentlon program
launched In a similar company.
# üçé Translating technical results
# üìò tech or non-tech approach?
- `tech` knowledge is ***continuum***
- `data professionals` care more about ***methods***
- `audience` care more about ***results and implications***
# üìö how technical?
we may need to explain...
- Low accuracy predictions to supply chain agents
  - Don't care about stats 
  - Care about their own pain points
- `requires TRANSLATION into stories`: for non tech
  -  easy to undertand
  -  engage audience : stake holders
  -  ***decision making***
  -  ***drive change***
  -  strategies
# üìö strategies
## ‚û°Ô∏è AWARNESS
- ***what do they know?*** : adjust context
  - how our model works? ==> ***Prediction's impacts and limitations***
- ***what do they need to understand*** : be conversational
  - why we chose predictive vars? ==> ***context in which our model works***
- ***what level of info d they need?*** : serve audience
  - correlation coefficients between vars ==> ***interactions between customer traits***  
## ‚û°Ô∏è ADEPT
> Kalid Azad
- `Analogy` : so audience can relate new uncomfortable things w /things they already know
  - be cautious with ***acronyms*** : can help or hurt communication
    - introduce the ***term*** then the ***acronym***  
- `Diagram` : visualize for efficiency
- `Example`
- `Plain English`
- `Technical definition`
### ‚û°Ô∏è technical jargon
- translate terminology
- simple/familiar terms
- include guide for deffinitions in report
## üî¥ Humility
- `Be receptive` to questions
- `Proactively ensure undertanding` : clear?, questions?
- `explain differently`: do it again if needed changing strategies to convey concepts
# A non-tech story
> Correctly classify the examples as more suitable either for a tech or non-tech stories.

- Tech story
  - After several Iterations, the elbow method showed that 4 was the optimal
number of clusters to run K-means.
  - Churn and no-churn customers show a different probablity denslty
distributlon of the number of months a customer has subscribed for.
  - The ANOVA showed that payment methods affect churn rate even
though SEM Is very high.
  - To understand which features had the most predictive relevance, the
feature Importance permutation was used.
- Non-tech story
  - Imagine that It rains and you have to go to an event. What factors wll
you consider to go or stay at home? That's how feature Importance
works
  - The churn customers have subscrilbed for fewer months than customer
that did not churn.
  - A customer that pays with credit card tends to churn less than a
customer that pays with a malled check.
  - The clustering analysls, a model to group customers based on thelr
sImlaritles, showed four types of customers to target with the program
# Be aware
> Correctly classify the examples as either best practice or bad practice.
- Best practice
  - Explain that the predictions you made will help target specifically some
customers. It will save money for the company in marketing campaigns.
  - At the end of the report, Include a page with all the terminology
definittons and the acronyms you could not avold.
- Bad practice
  -Adust your content to Include some explanation on why you choose y
varlables for analysis, from a business perspective.
  - Do not Include analogles to explaln a concept with simple terms as It
could be confusing and disengaging.
  - When sending the report, anticipate any questions the business team
have. Answer them thoroughly so they know you are willing to help.
