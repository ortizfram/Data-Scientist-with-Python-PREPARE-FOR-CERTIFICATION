> One of the following options is ***True***. Can you select which one is it?
- [ ] Both graphs showed clearly how the salary changed for the three different jobs. Both are meaningful ways of expressing the same insight and convey clearly the message.
- [ ] The graph on the left, showing total values, is the most suitable one. The changes in salary are observed. No adjustment is needed as you'd rather show raw than transform data.
- [x] The graph on the right is the best way to convey the message. With percentage change, the magnitude of the salary change depending on the job is more evident.
# On a payroll
> Correctly classify the following examples as total values, change or ratio.
- Total
  - You want to highlight how much total overtime a
company paid for employees working as electronic
maintenance technician.
  - It would be interesting to show the total monthly
benefits employee will have the next six months.
- Change
  - The number of people working in the private sector
increased by 100k from 2017 to 2018.
  - An important finding is the fact that engineer
experimented a 50% increase in their salary in 2018,
while business analysts only 30%.
- Ratio
  - The average total pay per worker did not significantl
increase from 2014 to 2015.
# It's not significant
> Correctly classify the following examples as either a good use or a misuse.
- Good use
  - The base pay salary is higher (p-value: 0.03) for a physician than for a special
use. You will report it but interpret this result with caution.
  - The mean overtime pay show higher values (p-value: 0.04) for a department
head than for medical examiner. You don't consider this strong evidence.
- Misuse
  - The mean base pay is higher for an accountant than a lawyer. P-value is the
strongest evidence. There is no other interesting alternative to check.
  - The mean total pay is lower (p-value: 0.002) for firefighters than for
department chiefs. It's a bigger difference than for captain (p-value: 0.01).
From evaluating the p-value, you consider there is enough proof thata nurse
and a doctor have the same base pay.

biotechnology sector from 2017 to 2021.

that is accessible to a business stakeholder
- Bad practice
  - Include a detailed feature importance graph, with coefficients, to show which
factor has influenced the most.
  - Include a line plot that shows the average salary in the public health sector
from 2017 to 2021 to compare with the private sector. 
# Salary on demand
> Order the steps chronologically: the first step should be on top and the last step at the bottom.

employees

# A communication problem
- Your coworker has been working on a project on price predictions. He asks you to help him choose the most suitable format to deliver his results to the executive board as well as to his team.
You give him a set of advice and rules of thumb, so he can make an informed decision. When you arrive home, you realize that you made one mistake.
> Which of the following advice should you not have provided?
- [ ] The amount of time the CEO can dedicate to getting up to speed with your analysis is an important factor in your choice of delivery format.
- [x] If a software engineer in your team wants to continue your project with new data, the central piece of information to include in your meeting is the project conclusions.
- [ ] If your project manager, located in a different time zone, needs your results to communicate them to customers, a written report would be ideal.

***tech colleagues would be interested in understanding the methodology you used and the results you obtained. It will help them replicate your project.***
# Should we meet?
- It's Friday. Your project manager comes by your desk. She asks you about the status of your project on salaries for San Francisco employees. She tells you that you need to close the project. Fortunately, you have finished building the model.
But to close it, you need to communicate the results to the different stakeholders. After she talks with the people involved, you start to receive emails asking about the results. You need to decide if you are going to use an oral presentation or a written report.

  it with an internal application on the backend.
# When in doubt
