# ==> Importing flat files from the web
### > urllib package
`hihg-level interface for fetching data  across the web`
- `urlopen()` : accepts links instead of names
# --> automate file download in py
```py 
from urllib.request import urlretrieve
url = "https://.............."
url.retrieve(url, 'nameAs.csv')
```
# Importing flat files from the web: your turn!
- Import the function urlretrieve from the subpackage urllib.request.
- Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
- Use the function urlretrieve() to save the file locally as 'winequality-red.csv'.
- Execute the remaining code to load 'winequality-red.csv' in a pandas DataFrame and to print its head to the shell.
```py
# Import package
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'


# Save file locally
urlretrieve(url, 'winequality-red.csv')

# Read file into a DataFrame and print its head
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
print(df.head())
```
# Opening and reading flat files from the web
- Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
- Read file into a DataFrame df using pd.read_csv(), recalling that the separator in the file is ';'.
- Print the head of the DataFrame df.
- Execute the rest of the code to plot histogram of the first feature in the DataFrame df.
```py# Import packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Read file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv(url ,sep=';')

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Plot first column of df
df.iloc[:, 0].hist()
plt.xlabel('fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm$^3$)')
plt.ylabel('count')
plt.show()
```

# Importing non-flat files from the web
- Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
- Read the file in url into a dictionary xls using pd.read_excel() recalling that, in order to import all sheets you need to pass None to the argument sheet_name.
- Print the names of the sheets in the Excel spreadsheet; these will be the keys of the dictionary xls.
- Print the head of the first sheet using the sheet name, not the index of the sheet! The sheet name is '1700'
```py
# Import package
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://assets.datacamp.com/course/importing_data_into_r/latitude.xls'

# Read in all sheets of Excel file: xls
xls = pd.read_excel(url, sheet_name=None)

# Print the sheetnames to the shell
print(xls.keys())

# Print the head of the first sheet (using its name, NOT its index)
print(xls['1700'].head())
```
# ==> HTTP requests to import files from the web
## --> get request using urllib
```py
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request
url = "https://wikipedia.com"
request = Request(url)
response = urlopen(url)
html = response.read()
response.close()
```
# Performing HTTP requests in Python using urllib
- Import the functions urlopen and Request from the subpackage urllib.request.
- Package the request to the url "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2" using the function Request() and assign it to request.
- Send the request and catch the response in the variable response with the function urlopen().
- Run the rest of the code to see the datatype of response and to close the connection
```py
# Import packages
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request

# Specify the url
url = "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2"

# This packages the request: request
request = Request(url)

# Sends the request and catches the response: response
response = urlopen(request)

# Print the datatype of response
print(type(response))

# Be polite and close the response!
response.close()
```
      <class 'http.client.HTTPResponse'>
# Printing HTTP request results in Python using urllib
- Send the request and catch the response in the variable response with the function urlopen(), as in the previous exercise.
- Extract the response using the read() method and store the result in the variable html.
- Print the string html.
- Hit submit to perform all of the above and to close the response: be tidy
```py
# Import packages
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request

# Specify the url
url = "https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/1606/4135?ex=2"

# This packages the request
request = Request(url)

# Sends the request and catches the response: response
response = urlopen(request)

# Extract the response: html
html = response.read()

# Print the html
print(html)

# Be polite and close the response!
response.close()
```
# Performing HTTP requests in Python using requests
- Import the package requests.
- Assign the URL of interest to the variable url.
- Package the request to the URL, send the request and catch the response with a single function requests.get(), assigning the response to the variable r.
- Use the text attribute of the object r to return the HTML of the webpage as a string; store the result in a variable text.
- Hit submit to print the HTML of the webpage.
```py
# Import the package requests.
import requests

# Specify the url: url
url = "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation"

# Packages the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extract the response: text. Return the HTML of the webpage as a string; 
text = r.text

# Print the html
print(text)
```
# ==> Scraping the web in Python
# --> BeautifulSoup
make tag soup beautiful and extract info
```py
from bs4 import BeatifulSoup
import requests
url = 'https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/'
r = requests.get(url)
html_doc = r.text
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)
```
# --> prettified soup
      print(soup.prettify())
# --> beatiful soup methods
      print(soup.title)
      print(soup.text())
      #
      for link in soup.findall('a'):
            print(lnk.get('href'))
